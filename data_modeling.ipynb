       " 'remember the moment in the movie jurassic park when dr grant raced across the plains of the jungle on the back of a galimums while shooting his machine gun at attacking helicopters how about when he trecked through ancient aztec ruins while shooting flame thrower equiped janitors and dont forget the time he ran around on a cargo ship while blowing up floors and engines with his arsenal of grenadeswhat you dont recall those action packed moments neither do i but thats whats presented in the sega genesis game jurassic park rampage editionjurassic park rampage edition jpre takes an alternate more action paced look at the classic story of dinosaurs gone amok on a jungle island where in the books and the movies grant was a quiet paleontologist who just wanted to dig up ancient bones in the desert here hes become a super military commando who makes rambo look like ronald mcdonald where in the movie and books grant was focused on getting off the island without becoming dinosaur food here hes shooting everyone and everything in sightwhich isnt necessarily a bad thing due to the fact that everyone and everything on the island is out to kill himit should be said up front right now jpre is the most unintentionally silliest games ive ever played all the little factors add up to create an experience that is so silly and so dorky in all its aspects that one cant help but chuckle when you look back on the experiencewhere to begin well lets start with the other humans for some reason jurassic park is populated with thousands of soliders and janitors both who are equipped with military weapons and are for some reason out to kill you no matter where you go youll find dozens of soldiers and janitors shooting at you and chucking grenades in your direction luckily grant can survive multiple grenade hits so its not too much of a problem its a mystery why these guys are out to kill you when theres no logical reason to it furthermore they seemed to have made an alliance with the local dinosaurs because they never attack them and the dinosaurs never attack them as well it seems that poor grant is under the crosshairs of every single living thing on the islandevery stage you go through in the game with the exception of grants final level is packed to the brim with a riddiculous number of soldiers janitors raptors compys spitters and even a triceratops or two how do you deal with these threats heres a hint you run you run your stubbly little legs as fast as you can while the whole point of jpre is to be an action packed game where you shoot every living thing in sight its simply much more efficent to just run and jump your way to the exit with this method you can finish the game in about twenty minutesif you want you can go through the game and try to kill everything with your enormous arsenal of weapons more on those later its simply not really worth the effort for one thing youll probably get hit a lot trying to inflict damage on your enemies trying to kill raptors is a pain in the butt due to faulty hit detection a raptor or two will jump next to you and start bitting and whacking away with thier tails as you frantically fire your shotgun over and over again trying to hit them yet they take no damage so you leap away and start firing and finally kill them after several shots as a result of not being able to hit them at point blank range youve lost 34th of your health and a lot of ammo has been wasted when attacking kamikazie soldiers and janitors its very common to have several grenades chucked in your direction before you even get a shot off result loose health before you even take out one guyand lets not even talk about the wackiest enemy in the game attack helicopters yes thats right when going through the savanna level grant is constantly being assaulted by attack helicopters that fire rockets at him when i saw one coming onto the scren for the first time i had to pause the game because i was laughing too much to keep going here i was just trying to get across that blasted savanna being attacked by grenade chucking soldiers and machine gun equipped janitors and here im being attacked by an attack helicopter what kind of psycho island is this thankfully these helicopters can be driven away by shootingof all thingstranquilizer darts into them wheefortunitly to counter the threat of attack helicopters and flamethrower equipped janitors you have an enormous arsenal of military grade weapons at your disposal  no longer satisfied with gas grenades and puny tranquilizer pistols from the original jurassic park game on the sega genesis grant has an arsenal of death dealing weaponry ranging from shotguns to machine guns to rockets and death dealing grenades  all of these get the job done but the greatest satisfaction comes from using the greatest weapon in the history of video games  the electric gun or as i call it the zappy gun  this amazingly fun weapon doesnt just kill bad guys it disintigrates them  simply fire the gun watch the bolt of electricity go out and when it hits the janitor hell go ogh briefly turn into a skeleton and vanish into thin air  it sounds brutal but its absoloutly hilarious to watch and lets face it disintigrating an incredibly annoying enemey is tremendously satisfying  as an added bonus it also does the disentigration effect on dinosaurs as wellif one wants to have lots of gunning and running action while shooting dinosaurs then youll certianlly get it while playing this game  going through each level pits you against literally hundreds of soliders and dinosaurs so much so that at times its easy to get overwhelmed  fortunitly the game does include a desperatly needed checkpoint system which was missing in the first genesis game  this is the kind of game that you can play two ways  you can run and try to survive to get to the end or you can take your time and kill everything you come across so you do get a bit of freedom when it comes to how you playbut even with all the guns the sillyness of the game and even the checkpointsjpre just isnt much fun to play  as i said earlier its fairly easy to be overwhelmed by enemies in some levels but the game eventually just boils down to run and shoot or just run  there are items you collect for points but those points dont do anythingat its core jpre is a simple run around and shoot em up shooter  it has good graphics some nice music i do like the jazzrock theme but whether you like it or not is really up to personal taste  if you like mindless action games with gunslots of gunsthen you might like this  with many emulators on the internet why not try downloading it and giving it a try  you just might find yourself getting a laugh or two messing around with those crazy janitors',\n",

       " 'for those new to everquest it should be noted that while ruinsof kunark is an expansion for everquest it does contain the entiregame and thus you dont need to buy anything else to playwhile everquest is called a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game mmorpg i find the roleplaying designation rather misleading as is the case in most computer rpgs  there is actually very little roleplay occurring in everquest at least in terms of people acting as if they actually are their characters instead of someone sitting at a keyboard playing a game  if you play penandpaper rpgs such as dampd and youre looking for an online extension of the hobby youll be better off looking into text based muds mushes and other musat its simplest level gameplay in everquest consists of killing various monsters so you can loot their bodies for items you can either use yourself or sell to someone else be it one of the games automated merchants or another player for money with which to buy nicer equipment for yourself so you can kill stronger monsters and repeat the process  if that sounds repetitive thats because it is there is one basic strategy in the game isolate the monsters so you can preferably fight them one at a time  each class has different abilities which requires them to approach this strategy from different directions but ultimately theyre all doing the same thingdespite the simplicity of the gameplay or perhaps because of it everquest is an incredibly addictive game  at the lower experience levels rewards come often enough in the form of new levels and skills to make things really fun  as you advance in the game things then become more interesting because youre able to go more places do more things and start acquiring special items for your characterhowever all good things must come to an end and eventually the game becomes rather tiresome because the higher your level the slower the game becomes warriors and other melee sorts find themselves spending long periods of time sitting around doing nothing while they heal up from their last battle  spellcasters also spend a lot of time sitting around recovering the mana needed to cast spells and they have to keep their noses buried in the spellbooks to do it so they cant even watch whats going on around them while theyre doing it  healers not only have to meditate to recover mana but at higher levels they often have to do it in the middle of combat which means they miss most of the actioneverquest wastes time in other ways as well  many of the nicer items in the game are dropped by specific creatures which appear at set spawn points at regular intervals  this means that if you want that particular item you have to go to that spawn point and kill whatever appears there over and over until the creature youre looking for appears many are rare and only have a small percentage chance of appearing any time the spawn point quotpopsquot and hope that it drops the item youre looking for many of the better items being rare which means that there is only a small percentage chance that the creature will actually have the item when it appears  this means that you can spend hours sitting in one place killing the same thing over and over again hoping to get a particularly nice item  not only that but since youre probably not the only player in the game that wants that item youll have to stand in line to do it  fortunately ruins of kunark alleviates the problem somewhat by placing nice items on random monsters in the lands of kunark so that you can pick up nice gear without having to camp a particular spawnand these are just a few of the ways in which the game wastes your timegraphically everquest has always been the leader of the mmorpgs though asherons call did have superior environmental graphics until rok was released with the release of rok everquest now uses two seperate graphics engines  the quotold worldquot which consists of the lands contained in the original game still use the original graphics engine which is now 34 years old because the publisher verant interactive couldnt legally change the system requirements once the game was released  however the quotnew worldquot which consists of the lands added in the expansion use a brand new graphics engine the result is that the quality of graphics varies within the game the old world is kind of mediocre by todays standards while the new world looks very very nicesound leaves something to be desired in everquest and i have never considered it to be more than mediocre the game uses a midi music soundtrack which some people myself included find rather annoying  there is no way to turn it completely off but you can turn the volume of it down so low that you cant hear it  many creatures share the same footstep sounds so you cant tell the difference between them unless you can actually see them  one of the things i like about asherons call is that i can identify whats approaching me by the sound of its footsteps  there is also no variance in sound for surface so you sound exactly the same whether youre running on stone wood dirt grass sand or snow  some of the creature noises are nice but others are rather wanting  for example when crocodiles and alligators are hit they sound suspiciously like someone trying to start a chainsaw  at the time of this writing sound is bugged in the lands of kunark  many of the new creatures use the same sounds as humans  its rather odd to see a mosquito fly past you and hear footsteps as it does so  verant is working on a patch to correct this but its rather annoying that rok was released with such a significant bug in placein a game like this customer support is very important  unfortunately verant has a well deserved reputation for providing exceptionally bad support  if youre in need of tech support youre better off turning to your fellow players on the various everquest bbses to be found on the web than verants tech support which has been known to take a week just to send you a form email telling you to provide them with information you already provided them with when you initially contacted them  in game support is provided by paid gms and volunteer guides unfortunately the guides generally dont have the power to do much for you and the gms have earned reputations for being capricious rude and surly towards the players  some have even been known to just kill characters out of hand for such minor offenses as walking up and speaking to them while the gm is standing in a public areawhile verant advertises everquest as a dynamic world it is largely static which things mostly staying exactly the same  special events usually take the form of a gm ambushing player characters with a monster vastly more powerful than they are and indiscriminately slaughtering people until someone manages to summon some higher level players to come save them  many people have learned to avoid zones where special events are taking place for just this reason  for some odd reason they dont think being killed by something they have no chance of defeating is very funovercrowding is another problem within the game but this exapansion has at least provided some temporary relief as many players have rushed to the new areas which are quite large to check them out  its too soon to tell if this is a permanent solution or if people are going to gravitate to certain spots where the best lootexp is located as happened in the old world andor if verant is going to continue to allow the server populations to once more grow to beyond the point that the game was designed to handleoverall everquest is a fun and addictive game but it has some flaws that become more and more serious the longer you play the game  youll love it in the beginning but you may find yourself becoming more and more frustrated as you encounter the games design limitations  its probably the best mmorpg on the market

       " 'as is the case with many of these 4 and 5 star reviews i was impressed with the concept and glitz of everquest in the first month that i bought the game  it wasnt until about a month into the game thati realized the true colors of the game as i became extremely bored or angry everytime  that i played  i would put hours into the game at a time and not  accomplish anything  so i quit  canecelled my account and didnt play the  game for 6 months  just recently i got bored and reactivated my account to  see if anything had changed but i was dissappointed to find that the game  was in the same sad  state as when i leftthere are so many bad things  about this game but i will try to list them here in brief form1  verant company that made the game is money hungry and does not listen to  or take input from its players at all  in fact through its customer  service policies the company proves that it assumes all players are  snottywhinycheatingscammers  if you doubt any of this all you need to  do is read the official everquest forum at check out  the gameplay forum especially this is the only forum that the only public  relations employee at verant reads so its where most of the players go to  speak their mind2 the only way to advance your character is by  leveling up since you cannot get experience any other way  technically you  can get experience by doing quests but its so little thats its not worth  the effort  since characters are defined by classes almost all characters  of the same class and level are exactly the same3 there are tons  of bugs in this game and with such a poor customer service department if  you die from a bug you are screwed  you could lose all of  your items and  money due to a bug but you will not be compensated4 the economy is  out of control  i mean it doesnt work at all  inflation is so bad that  at high levels money becomes useless5 trade skills are useless andor  not profitable for some reason in everquest trade skills such as  smithingfletchingtailoring etc are useless  the time and money you  put into these skills will never pay off since the cost to buy the raw  goods often exceed the profit you make by selling the product  several of  the trade skills have been broken since day one such as alchemy6  the downtime in between fights can be huge  seriously once you pass level  10  you have to wait several minutes in between each fight to restore your  hit points and magic points  at the higher levels i heard it takes as long  as 20 minutes to recover mana and during this time your character must be  sitting down and not doing anything at all  so i guess the players of  everquest are supposed to read a book or do their laundry during these long  periods of downtime7 oh yeah due to the way the game is structured  its not really an rpg  its a hack and slash game where the only purpose  is to gain more levels  the quests are far and few in between and most of  them are pretty lame  the players have absolutely no impact on the world  you cannot join an army or hold a goverment position or any kind of job  for that matter  you are good for nothing other than killing monsters out  in the wilderness which after a while gets really boring8 the  creatures that give the best loot are quotcampedquot  247 meaning  that several groups will sit and wait at the areas where these monsters  spawn and kill it as soon as it spawns and then wait again for however  long it takes for the monster to spawn again sometimes hours  again  this is very lame and boringoh well i guess thats enough reasons for  now although iquotm sure i could think of more if i tried oh yeah the  grouping system is not good  you can only effectively group with people  near you in level otherwise neither person will gain experiencemy  advice  in my opinion there arent any good mmorpgs out right now  asherons call has potential  you can try everquest if you are bored and  want to see what these online games are like but dont let it dissappoint  you the way it did me  the game has lots of potential but for whatever  reason verant fell flat on its face as far as making any of it work',\n",

       " 'this review will talk about both the ch rudder pedals and the ch flight yoke usbi finally got around to purchasing these rudder pedals from amazon after accepting that i was never going to find this item in stores getting to the pointthese pedals are a must have for serious flightsimmersespecially if you own microsoft flight simulator and like to fly general aviation or the large commercial heavies i also purchased the usb ch flight yoke for 9974 the difference these 2 items make to the simming experience cant be stressed enough if you ever got the guilty feeling after mastering the greased landing with the boeing 747 or other heavy aircraft the feeling that its unrealistically easy then this is the next level it takes a lot more concentration and coordination to master flight using yoke and rudder as opposed to just a joystick or keyboardjust keep your hands off the yoke while going down the runway or taxiing and you should be able to keep things in order you may also consider purchasing the ch throttle thats going to be next on my list because using the throttle controls as they are postitioned on the yoke are a little inconvenient for some aircraft that require constant changes in throttle positionoverall im satisfied with the construction of the pedals they weigh in at around 6 pounds and feel fairly solid and sturdy the motion is fairly smooth with the application of both rudder and toe brakes they work well not much more you can say about that the same can be said about the construction of the yokefairly solid considering i would like to have seen a little less tension on the yoke personally unless you are trimmed close to overtrimmed status you have to give it a good pull to get airborne i havent studied it long enough to see how that really compares between heavy versus light aircraft but again i think that only speaks to the construction of the unit and the strength of the clamp setup pulling back on that unit with a fair amount of force and the unit doesnt budge from the desk the yoke may take some getting used to based on where it will sit on your deskin my case there is about a half an inch beneath the fastened clamps to allow for my slide out keyboard tray which was enough space in my case i could see a potential problem in that area for othersive read about complaints with the clamp system on the yoke but id like to meet the guy that can think of a better solution to keep the unit stationary on your desktopno problems with my particular desk and the clamps what ive read is that people with lips or other unperfect edges may have problems since the surface area of the clamps is small again not a problem with my particular desk another con that i read about and can somewhat concur with is the trim quality i find myself having to adjust the elevator trim more frequently with changes in speed than with my joystickon approach this can be viewed as a nuisance or part of the greater challenge ill have to give it some time to decide on that one it may be that its just easier overall with a joystick i was looking for more realism and a greater challenge when i purchased the yoke and rudderinstallation was a breeze in windows xp just plug them in and they are ready to go they come with a cd with any drivers that may not be installed already and also games so ive heardmsfs is my favorite past time probably wouldnt fly anything else that i dont already own anyway another good thing about this unit and msfs is that it is recognized as a separate controller i have used the pedals in combination with the flight yoke as well as my saitek x52 flight control system when i needed a joystick and not a yoke for flying fighters or even general aviation aircraft that have sticks and not yokesfinally both the yoke and rudder are a very good investment for the hobby youll find yourself enjoying the hobby more and actually steering clear of the autopilot controls hope this gives you some things to think about',\n",

       " 'compared to the previous indianna jones game the infernal machine this game is phenomenal the graphics are gorgeous and the frame rates are fineon my highend pc the controls take a while to get used to but if you are experienced with using the mouse and keyboard or if you have a game controller you will be fine with the control aspectthe levels are designed well with an intrigueing story line and cool prelevel cut scenes another great aspect of the game that many people have overlooked is its perfect balance of guns and handwhip combat the last indy game left his fists with no real use but this game is remarkable and extremely fun when it comes to fist fighting the fights are long and leaves you with lots of room to improviseleft mouse button is left hand right button right hand i am also able to grab the opponent and then do a variety of combomove on him such as punching as i hold him knee him headbutt or throw over  a cliff or into a wall if your skilled enough you can even get your opponent into a headlock the guns on the other hand do not kill the opponent in one shot and have precious ammo as it should be it is often easier to whip a gun out of an opponents hand and beat the crap out of him with your fistsmany people have complained that you are unable to save a game where ever you want but i like it like that it is more challenging and organized and leaves me without all those save files that i lose track of i have not had the problem of having to redo a section over and over again from dieing right at the end ive been playing the game on normal difficulty through 6 levels and have only gotten to the end of a section and die once so it really shouldnt be considered a problem i highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an adventurous actionpacked challenging fun fastpaced intruiging challenging exciting intense fun wellmadegame',\n",
       " 'after seeing the indiana jones trilogy which i thought was excellent i decided to buy a copy of indiana jones and the infernal machine  this was rather disappointing simply because of the poor hand to hand fighting system  within two days of the release of the emperors tomb i purchased it and realized that it outperformed its predecessor by great lengths  much of the game centres aroung hand to hand combat with foes that have a great knowledge of the martial arts  and yes the nazis from the films are backone of the games best aspects is the seemingly endless range of weapons  indy can use improvised weapons such as liquor bottles and flaming torches in addition to his trusty whip and revolver  have any of you ever wanted to use the threebladed frisbee that you were amazed at in the opening scene of the movie blade  you have your opportunity right here  and  of course the cool shotguns and tommy guns are back  where hand to hand fighting is concerned indys selection of moves now include kicks uppercuts grabs and even strangleholds  a combination of these allows you to kick some nazi posteriorthe games plot has something to do with a powerful and mysterious artifact known as the heart of the dragon that you have to travel across the globe to recover  i would love to reveal more of the games plot but doing so would spoil the fun for youas usual indys sidekick is a seductive young woman you can guess the ending  she plays a huge part in the game and has cool ninja skills  she will throw knives knock enemies off cliffs and fight successfully with indy to recover the artifact  her oufits are what caught my attention howeversound  the sound effects and well above average but it is the voice acting that is outstanding it is straight out of a filmgraphics  these are smooth and work well on my pc 2600 mhz amd athlon 1gb ram  even during the most intense firefights there are no slowdowns  though i have no idea what engine is used in the game it certainly does the jobgameplay  as described above this is very good yet the controls may need remapping for optimum gamingthere are such few downsides to the game that they are hardly worth a mention  despite this the inability to save during levels is a small annoyance because i often end up dying right near the end  for some weird reason the camera packs up when indy has his back to a wall making fighting near it almost impossibleoverall as expressed by the reviews title i rate this game very highly and would seriously recommend to all gamers  fans of thirdperson fighting games such as mortal konbat will love this but even those who arent should at least try it',\n",
       " 'the game play for indiana jones and the emperors tomb is very poor  as others have said there is no save option in this game and the exit and loading screens are very confusing and unnecessary  the camera panning is horrible you have to move the mouse and the keys to control the character and it takes a lot of getting used to  although the sound and graphics is excellent and i had some fun with the fighting its too much of a hassle to control the characteri will echo what someone else said about the tram sequence being one of the most pointless in pc gaming history',\n",
       " 'this game is one of the most frustrating games ive ever played bad1 it does not allow save points and auto saves at the start of every level thereby if indy dies you have to restart from the level bad2 i always prefer using mouse left button to move forward and right button to move back but its camera movement keys are hardcoded for the same i still managed to use the mouse for movement but for swinging using indys whip ive had to change the movement keys because then the mouse buttons would not let me swing indy and swinging using the whip is to be done scores of times bad 3 most levels are very very tough fall in the watersharks attack swingsomeone shoots so be prepared to play levels innumerable timesbutgood 1the graphics are awesome some levels like the china amp istanbul levels are to be seen to be believed truly beautiful good 2 the fight sequences are just great kicking fisting fighting using table legs bottles or other items is superb good 3 some of the puzzles are very good the graphics used to showing the puzzles like the zodiac clock is wonderful all in all the tough levels the frustration in restarting the levels add to ones determination to finish this frustrating yet awesome game i hope lucas arts corrects the bad points and bring out an indy iii game soon',\n",

       " 'what a terrible disappointment  ive begun playing the pc version of indy and the emperors tomb but the keyboard control of his movement is very clumsy  with high quality engines like the quake architecture available theres no excuse for such aggravating movement problemsbut the worst thing is that the game does not allow you to save games  after working through a long series of actions should you slip and die you have to go back to the beginning of the level where the game may have saved a start point  you then have to work repeatedly through the same portions you have played just to get back to a simple action pointmiss a jump  too bad you have to crawl through a series of very difficult steps fighting the lousy control engine just to get back to try a single actionhow could they screw up such a great game so badlya very disappointed indy fan',\n",

       " 'i remember when i was around 6 or so and the atari 2600 came out well there was a raiders of the lost ark game that came out for it of course back then it was just a bunch of blocks made up to look like indy or whatever was around him i had always wondered what it would be like to play a video game that actually looked like the front of the box back in those days well in this day and age of gaming you dont have to worry it has happened and then some im 34 years old and have been and indiana jones fan since 81 when like i say i was around 6 i remember back in 2003 seeing the advertisements for this game and couldnt wait to get my hands on it i had a regular xbox back then so i bought it defeated it loved it so much defeated it again it wasnt until later the next year when i got a pretty decent laptopfor the time that i bought the game for pc it was able to run the game decently without much lag and was very enjoyable but difficult to play with the keyboard as most so now having a gaming rig that far surpasses anything from back in 2003 i can run the game at full everything which doesnt require much on ps2 the game looks way dated but on pc it still looks like it could have came out around 2005 or so the textures look great the camera is very accurate indys voice really does sound like harrison ford and the game is very long as it should be if your lucky enough to get it for pc definitely use a controller the keyboard is ok but some buttons and movements are effected and tedious to control this game is the best indy game to ever hit the market and i hope george lucas has a next gen game up his sleeve one was almost done they had screen shots and a special technic for the game so you would never play the same game twice what happened to that instead he gave us the simple and uninnovative staff of kings which was very sub par compared to this the nazis are here bounty hunters arabians strange monsters and just all kinds of this to do that make it a true adventure game they just dont make them like this anymore and maybe never will i want to see a new movie but i dont want it to have anything to do with aliens that seems to be very cliche and just doesnt fit with jones forte indiana is all about tombs caves booby traps nazis and jungles thats what i want from a new game and movie deliver it to the fans george and do it right this time make it more like this game instead of through in et this game is just fun from start to finish and youll finish it more than once nuff saidd',\n",

runaway a road adventure would receive its us release in 2003runaway revolves around the main character brian basco a physics student who was accepted to the university of california berkeley and planning to make his drive from the east coast to california but on the day he went to pick up a book at a book store the shy and nerdy student accidentally hits a woman named gina timmins with his caras brian stays with gina at the hospital and feeling bad of what took place gina quickly tells him that her father was killed by the mafia and before he died he gave her a crucifix  and now she needs to know why the mafia is after it and needs brians help as they are trying to kill herat first brian is not sure to believe in her but just in case while she rests in her hospital room he builds a fake person with pillows on the bed next to her and also switching her medical charts with the fake patient  while in the bathroom he hears gunshots and when he goes to check he realizes that gina was right  someone is trying to kill her and immediately he wakes gina up and both escape from the hospitalmeanwhile the two hitmen from the mafia gustav and feodor find out that gina was not killed and the mafia begin their chase after brian and gina who now travel throughout the country trying to evade the mafia but also trying to find out the truth of the crucifixinstallationsince this is an older game i installed it on a windows xp laptop and did a full installation  the 3 cdrom discs installed quickly but there was a problem  when i reached chapter 4 there was a source file missingafter going through the pendulo folderrunawaythere are two foldersresource and dataa which are missing the chapter 4 files looking online a few people have had this problem but im not sure why some people are having this problem but perhaps we had bad cdrom discs that didnt work during installationbut fortunately the good news is that by going through disc 2 just copy the resourcem04 file to the resource folder and you will also be missing a dataa 04 file which you copy to the dataa folder of where your game is installedfor those not computer relatedgo to my computer and open one window that goes to c driveprogram filespendulo softwarerunaway you will see several folders including dataa and resourcenow bring up your cddvd rom drive via a second window using my computer and go to those folders resource and copy the resourcem04 file from the cd to the resource folder on your hard drive to the other window and the dataa04 not the exact name but close to the dataa folder on your hard drivei tested it and it works perfectly this should fix the problemgameplaythe gameplay was fairly easy  click on where you want to go right click to grab or use the mouse to look at things  then you can combine objects that you find in order to solve certain situations for the most part the game is easy as there is no button or mouse intensive movements  so for those wanting something not so intensive like adventure games on consoles which require precise button movements need not worry with runaway a road adventuregameplay requires visiting areas and finding certain objects that can be reused in another areaif there is anything that hampers gameplay is that there are moments that require quite a bit of backtracking and  for the less patient players like myself it does get a bit tedious  for example during a scene in the desert at douglasville one needed to pour water in a derailed trains water tank  thats fine but to go from the train back to the area where the water is located takes time and you have to walk back and forth multiple times in order to fill that tank up  definitely tediousthere are easy puzzles and choice selections but the game doesnt require one to choose a right choice  if anything you can ask all the questions and eventually get an answer without risking anythinggraphicsfor a game that was created in 2003 while there are expected artifacts for a game that is nearly 10yearsold stilli enjoy the vibrancy of the colors and painted backgrounds  pendulo used a game engine that made the overall game look like a cartoon 2d adventure but using realtime lighting and shading effects as well as camera changes and panoramic shots  i enjoy the overall design and if anything the game looks good for its ageaudiothe audio is good while some people are divided about the voice acting i felt that the voice acting for brian and gina were good at times some parts felt a bit flat but overall the two main characters were good but other characters they sound a bit goofy but considering the characters that are being portrayed it worksthe music is pretty cool  it kind of reminded me of a poppy version of the cranberries but the performance by liquor and composed by david garcia morales is pretty good  take note that if you want the soundtrack it is included with the special collectors edition of the gamereplay valuethere are none  once you beat the gametime to move on to game 2judgment callhaving waited so long to play runaway a road adventure due to my backlog of games that i play i have to say that i really enjoyed runaway a road adventure  its a fun adventure game about two characters wanted by the mafia but there are some situations that i felt were a bit messed upfor example brian and gina travel to chicago to museum where his friend works and possibly can help clean and find out information about the crucifix whereabouts  but something tragic happens and its quite lame of how the tragedies were forgotten especially when you are surprised by a twist at the end and if i was brian i would have been ticked that these adventures led to innocent people being gunned downi suppose that the game does take an amoral perspective when it comes to this but its the only part of the game that i felt was ridiculous  but thats when you tend to overthink about the game too much of how people should react knowing that video games unlike cinema dont usually explore the emotional dilemma of its characters and they tend to move on to the next chapter in the storylineotherwise the puzzles are quite intriguing and to see how one item can make a difference in another situation ie using lipstick and gun powder in a machine gun and the many uses of an mp3 recorder  some puzzles may require you to use a walkthrough i had to use it several times in order to find out where to go or why certain things are not working  if there was anything that drove me crazy about this game was the amount of  backtracking that can get a bit tedious but it depends on the players patiencebut the game is somewhat focused on the comingofage for the character of brian  hes a nerdy guy who eventually changes as the adventures continue and what would you expect when you see this brainiac save the beautiful damsel in distress  suffice to say its a banal storyline but who doesnt love a storyline about an underdog being with a gorgeous sidekickwhile the game has its share of tedious moments fortunately there are characters and situations that made this game quite enjoyable and fun  some may find some puzzles to be difficult and there are moments where you cant accomplish certain things unless you visit an area first  so there are moments where you have to walk from one area back to another and yes i emphasize the word tediousoverall runaway a

       " 'ok so i realize how critical ive been towards these games as a series i finally got the opportunity to play this game i really think for its time this game is pretty good before i bought this game i made the choice to read reviews for the game every review i read was different and every opinion was different but one review caught my eye and the reviewer was talking about this title being better than its sequel chamber of secrets and at first i was like scratching my head like huh what what is this person saying so then i left a comment on the review because in my mind the review made no sense but after playing the game now i was beginning to understand what that review really meant even though it said that sorcerers stone was better than chamber of secrets which was the persons opinion what the person actually implied was the year it came out vs the chronological order of the series see chamber of secrets came out in 2002 and sorcerers stone first came out in 2001 for pc playstation gameboy color gbc gameboy advance and mac os x following the release of the film then ea later announced a remake of this exact same title with respect in the uk this title being called philosophers stone and in the us sorcerers stone for gamecube xbox and ps2 came out in 2003 which now makes sense to me since this title is still the first game in the series but the gamecube version along with its xbox and ps2 counter parts were released laternow let me talk about the game first of all like the other hp games on gamecube like 23  4 this game relies on the spells in the game all rely on being assigned to different buttons and in this case the by and x buttons and they dont have to be assigned to specific buttons they can be assigned to any as long as it is b y or x whats really nice about this game is the alohomora spell issue is resolved allowing you to unlock doors unlike its sequel game chamber of secrets where you could not unlock doors but could  unlock chests otherwise you waste 80 bertie botts every flavor beans bbefb yeah i know wow how much stupider could companies like warner bros and electronic arts get well i will cut these companies some slack since for every video game company making a video game based on a movie well every video game has a deadline and thats completely understandable besides i am sure if warner bros wanted or wants to make changes to the game and make a deal with electronic arts then they will too bad this game will never be on future consoles oh well i prefer old over new any day of the weekthe game is more tricky than its sequel and can be tough but well worth the challenge and worth the money overall i love this game and boy was it a difficult find but i love it and its staying in my ever expanding collection of gamecube games however since this is such a rare game it can still be worth some cash even if its used for me this game with the cost of shipping was altogether 3000 i bought it from source media on amazoncom so that was nice heres what makes me really happy about this purchase first of all this game was in an original nintendo gamecube case not a generic case inside the case being was the disc manuel precautions booklet and had the original cover art and even though the seller said it was like new it was more like used and in good condition but the disc was like new and had 0 scratches overall i am very happy with this product and will stay in my gamecube collection and along with the other harry potter games i own for gamecube and wii',\n",

unscripted relying instead upon this games underrated ai both your squad mates and your enemies are pretty smart about staying alive and using cover its very satisfying to relieve your pinned down squad by finding a way to flank your enemies and then blast them from their rear sometimes the hardest part of a firefight is just finding where the enemy is hiding using cover is paramount to surviving and so is popping out from behind cover to deliver quick blasts with your weapon enemies will attempt to do the same to you however sometimes when you are winning a battle the last couple of guys in a japanese squad will rush at you screaming in a mad desperate banzai frenzy this leads to some truly memorable momentsthe medic is a great mechanic that seems to borrow from games like halo and vietcong the idea is that instead of picking up frequent health packs and armor you can be healed if you find some safe cover for a while this adds a tactical level to the game that most first person shooters dont havethe jungle scenes are the best part of this game in every way its too bad that you have to play the game for an hour and a half before you experience them thats how long it takes you to get through the tutorial level and the disappointing pearl harbor level the game mixes up the action quite a bit specifically there are railshooter and turretshooter sequences sprinkled here and there where you shoot at enemies while riding in the back of a truck or operate an antiaircraft gun and shoot down japanese zeroes there is even a flying mission none of these other missions are particularly memorable and some of them are quite bad there is one ridiculous shoot down zeroes with an aa gun scene that is literally impossible until you learn that there is a lame trick that makes it easy to complete in about 60 seconds it takes dozens of trialanderror quick save and reload sequences to learn this or you can look on the internet for it and this totally ruins that part of the gamethe visuals arent as nice as halflife 2 or far cry but they are still very good the water fire and smoke all look very nice best of all is the most beautiful and realistic looking sky that i have ever seen the jungle is also very convincing the music is sort of generic but its high quality stuff best of all the game feels very authentic it maintains the high drama of the other world war 2 games while giving it a different feel toothe campaign ends after about 10 hours which isnt very long considering that at least 2 or 3 of them are spent looking at the loading screen the way that the loading screens disrupt this games flow cannot be understated the ending is also horribly unsatisfying i absolutely hated the ending level of this game with a passion it is a maddeningly and impossibly difficult unforgving quick save fest where you are constantly getting cut down by two or three machine gun nests at a time all of which can reduce you from full health to zero in about two seconds the entire last two hours of the game is filled with trialanderror and trying to scamper from cover to cover in increments of about three feet reloading your game constantly as you get cut down in seconds the last level is filled with barbed wire which you cannot climb over and invisible walls which funnel you into these death trap trenches that have machine gun nests awaiting you at the end and absolutely no alternate path the game gives you no flamethrower or bazooka and no ability to call in naval strikes the design for this level is abysmal and its a shame that the awesome jungle levels are overshadowed by this frustrating turd in the punch bowlthe verdict  i guess its worth a look',\n",

       " 'medal of honor  pacific assault is in my opinion the best of the medal of honor games released for pc  it is a more powerful experience than even medal of honor airborne which has more intense gameplay because its constructed in a symphonic way  its a story with intense human depth more than a set of missions  the human aspect camaraderie and tedium of warfare get explored further than in the other games  the game is structured as an extended flashback  you start by storming the beach of tarawa which was kind of the midpoint of the pacific war then flash back to all your previous missions  boot camp training pearl harbor the night raid of the makin island guadalcanal and then return to tarawa  i have read criticisms that the game is very tedious because of the jungle setting but i didnt find it so at all  psychologically it is extremely good at making you feel like youre experiencing the fear and tedium but it is so engaging at the same time  the night missions have excellent graphics for making the enemy truly hard to perceive in the jungle and the cinematics all contribute to your understanding and appreciation of the characters  the guadalcanal mission which is the longest is appropriately situated in the middle and the game designers showed lots of creativity in giving you a variety of settings and missions in the jungle  i also like that pacific assault is more realistic than allied assault and its expansion games spearhead and breakthrough  the earlier games unrealistically enable you to storm dozens of enemies all by yourself without getting killed  this game forces you to stick with your group and be careful how you approach the japanese  the music is also very exciting  in the directors edition if you want special features get the directors edition there are special features which teach you about pacific battles of 19411943 how the game was made including music and graphics the propaganda war in wwii and the military color guard  this game is begging for a sequel you could go to the philippines iwo jima and okinawa  i think you will really like the experience if you play this game',\n",

       " 'ive read most of the reviews up to this point and am wondering what all the complaints are about im a baby boomer whos not into the technical aspects of computer games all i know is it didnt work on my threeyearold hp so i threw it into a brandnew dell and it worked very well obviously the hp needs an updated video cardanyway im not sure what a lot of gamers are looking for its just a game breaking the price down by the number of hours of entertainment youre getting and its a pretty good deal sure there are some glitches and some frustrating parts but overall its a lot of funim into historical accuracy and realism on that account mohpa is almost right on the money i appreciated the flashback technique you start out invading tarawa in lvts landing vehicle tracked  just like the real battle and once youre gravely wounded obviously inevitable you hear your old drill instructors voice ringing in your ears just before you lose conciousness you then flashback to two years earlier when youre in boot camp the boot camp sequence is fun the first time but it seems youre forced to go through it all over again if and when you want to play the game over on a harder setting you should be able to skip that part after youve gone through it oncethe pearl harbor makin atoll guadalcanal and tarawa sequences are the most realistic portrayals of any wwii battle ive seen since the omaha beach landing in the original moh well that is except for the stalingrad attack waves in call of duty somebody really did their research on this portion of moh some reviewers have complained that theres nothing but endless jungle and youre forced along a narrow path often that was the case in the pacific theater the terrain dictated your movement the jungle on makin and guadalcanal could be daunting claustrophobic and terrifying as one reviewer said the japanese usually knew the terrain better than we did which enabled them to ambush us and pour fire on prearranged kill zones while the hapless americans couldnt see a damned thing for the trees and thick underbrushthe pearl harbor segment is excellent sure there are a few too many japanese planes the real attack involved something like 350 but hey isnt that what a war game is about shooting enemy planes out of the sky you go from pt boat gunner to helping out on the uss west virginia not arizona as some have said  she was blown in half before you could board yes its sometimes frustrating finding your way below decks but isnt that how it would have been in a fire ravaged flooding ship about to capsizemaking you a member of the marine raiders is a clever addition before this game how many players had even heard of makin atoll landing by rubber boat launched from a submarine just like the real thing an even better detail is equipping you with a reising gun that slow and outdated piece of crap really was used by marines for a short time at the beginning of the war it didnt take long for the usmc to replace it with the thompson i especially like the tommy gun with the 50round drum magazine you can do some major damage with that baby the same goes for the 12gauge shotgun great for clearing trenches too bad you cant choose your own weapons and equipment like the outstanding hidden and dangerous the british sas wwii gameother smart details include the marine uniforms and vehicles on makin and guadalcanal the marines still had helmets with no camouflage covers like the army and wore hbt dungarees on henderson field on guadalcanal the planes are early war p39 airacobras and dauntless dive bombers a few wildcats would have been the icing on the cake for the tarawa invasion the marines were wearing fully camouflaged uniforms including helmet covers and the designers didnt forget this in later campaigns they only had the helmet coversa detail im assuming later editions of this game wont overlook maybe theres a peleliu and iwo jima sequence in the worksthe bloody ridge night battle on guadalcanal is awesome the red flares going off manning machine guns against repeated banzai charges falling back to higher groundall true great thought went into thisthe invasion of tarawa sequence is excellent on the actual island there really was a pier jutting out into the water that had to be cleared the same goes for a sunken freighter that the japanese placed snipers on as for being funneled through trenchlines to repeatedly clear machine gun nests and concrete bunkers thats the real deal i like the seaplane docked near the beach on makin nice detailnot all is peaches and cream with this game however the sequence where you and your buddies are joy riding as backseat gunners on dauntless dive bombers is ridiculous as i said im into realism your pilot gets wounded and bails out forcing you to crawl across the fuselage and fly the plane without an hours instruction on top of that youre then required to strafe a heavily armed island fight off numerous zeros and bomb and torpedo an aircraft carrier and destroyer get real once youve accomplished all of that theres a very tricky part where you have to stick with your squadron mates back to your own battle group or you run out of gas and splash totally unrealistic and completely unnecessary to make the whole thing even worse youre forced to do all of this with a mouse and keyboard no marine pfc was ever required to do so much this sequence almost ruins the game i couldnt wait to get past iti dont think the japanese had as many submachine guns as they do in this game theyre all over the place that enables you to grab one in case you run out of ammo but i think the real soldiers of the rising sun were pretty much equipped with boltaction rifles backed up by heavy machine gun emplacementsits very hard to win medals crikey after shooting down dozens of japanese planes at pearl harbor keeping a battleship from capsizing and saving the life of the ships xo youre rewarded with a lousy pfc stripe theres a silhouette of a medal you could have won but no clue as to what more you could do to win it after guadalcanal and god knows how many heroics above and beyond the call of duty the gunny told me he was putting me in for the silver star never saw it i did manage to win the navy cross on tarawa but didnt do anymore in that battle than the others the instructions should include more detail on the hidden objectives if there are any you can accomplish to win medals andor promotionsrequiring the navy corpsman although he actually starts up in boot camp with you  not true to life to heal you is an excellent addition the moh series got a bit crazy with all the first aid packs lying around how often does that happen in real battlesi wish thered be more to grab or make use of in the little villages you clear a samurai sword you can snatch for a souvenir as is the case in hidden  dangerous maybe some nasty canned fish japanese girlie magazines or anything else would be welcome additions how about more maps or other intelligence to earn points for snatching this is a minor request but it wouldnt take much programming and would add fun to playing to make sure im not missing any hidden objectives im continually searching every hut and mostly find boxes of ammo that you can use and swords hanging on hooks and officers map cases i cant access it gets a little tedious how about some things with japanese writing that turn out to be worthless to us intelligence that would be realisticthe bottom line is this is a very good game with a few glitches it is well worth the money and id recommend it i think too many gamers expect too much just play and have funas long as you can get it to work on your system',\n",

was ready to take it back but i gave it a while to be fair this review reflects online play only the offline game you can complete in 3 hours ok storylinegraphicsthe graphics are up to date as i expected since it has been a couple years since the last release the graphics for the maps are ok it seemed like the put the power into special effects special effects for weapons and when mechs blow up are amazing the lighting effects when missiles travel a crossed the terrain is really good youll see the lighting against the walls and trees and what not when mechs blow up the screen kind of warps and debris is sucked into the explosion really nice effect if a mechs blows up in water a bubble forms like in the last matrix movie when neo is fighting anderson neat water effects when walking through water the waves are realistic these neat effects are on some maps only some of the maps are amazing looking while other just plain out suck see new river city it looks like ps1 graphics maybe even kelico visionsoundthe sound is much better depending on what you are walking on the sound will change accordingly trees brush cement whatever level 3 weapons dont sound as striking as they did in the last game though i miss the level 3 gauze rifle sound you know when someone is leveled up in the first ma and you better run the second one i dont know if the person is level 1 or 3 i just know im standing there dieingthe gamefour more mechs to play with which is nice they arent that great but it is more choices you now have a vtol that you can carry items with to assist your teams mates the vtol is a great addition to team destruction this adds a great dynamic to the game be prepared to have people nag you for powers ups the entire game if you decide to play vtol you have a new tank which at first i thought was useless but in team you can knock a prometheus or an atlas on the ground and keep them there for your team to blast awayin destruction which i think they ruined you start out in power armor and most likely you will spend most of the game in the power armor you have to find a mech on the map or jack one you cannot pick the mech that you want i feel like they should have called this game mech jack ii for mech assault you sure spend a lot of time outside of a mechin destruction most likely the person that wins the game would note have even been in a mech the entire game you can score big points for jacking a mech so the incentive is to jack mechs for the entire game i spend more time doing the mini game see simon to keep my mech from being jacked more than anything yxyabrll basically youre forced to play giant killers the entire time if you remember right that was not a really popular game type in ma1 beats me i only play it once and thought it was stupidit took me 3 hours to find the right map and get into even a promi then 4 kids came up and eventually jacked it i havent seen a ragnarok or have even heard of its where abouts though i see a picture of it in the manual the fact that i dont have a choice in what mech i play pisses me off the most this goes for team destruction as well you have to beat your own team members to mechsgameplaythe mechs are excruciatingly slow and targeting is sluggish mechs are so slow it takes away from the aggressiveness of the game the maps are much bigger too which is great but try to get

it fast enough to your invite they had 2 years to think about this so i dont know why this wasnt fixed its nice in halo 2 when you start a room with 1 or 2 friends then eventually more people on your

       " 'the only ff i played was ff7 8 and 10 that was 10 years ago when ff13 came out i hesitated because i heard of bad things like how it was very linear and that they messed up the whole battle and leveling system how i was wrong for the first few hours of playing ff13 i quickly realized that it plays out like a movie everything you do is in one direction there was no puzzle and hardly any maze to slow you down you only sidemissions are to kill a certain enemy mob for rewards overall this is not necessarily a bad thing because i realized how all the older ff games had frustrating pointless puzzles with little guidance the old ff games were torture if you missed read a dialog you ended up running around town and the world map aimlessly and not knowing where the next objective was in ff13 there was always a map and guide arrow on the down side i wish that there was at least a world map in ff13 to run around in lol grand pulse is the closest thing to a world map but it is really just a bigger area with monsters to hunt very visually stunning though the leveling up system crystarium is like the sphere system from ff10 except a whole lot less confusion although i still like the ff7 materia system betterthe most important thing in an ff series is the battle system despite some other reviews the battle system is very easy to understand most of the time i just use the autoattack once you figure out how to effectively use the paradigm shift there is nothing else useful to learnyou can upgrade your weapons instead of finding better ones which is stupid let be honest you want to open up a chest and find a better bigger more bada looking gunblade instead of upgrading the same weapon which looks the same at every levelthe summons were pointless and since you only control one character in battle only one summon can be cast if you want to cast another summon you have to build up the tp points from battling and switch to controlling another character if you want a different summon generally summons were only good for rejuvenating the party and building up the stag gauge while staying alive summoning was kind of a hassle i beat the last boss without needing to summon the other abilities were kind of pointless too like quake which didnt do much damage i didnt summon that much because i was trying to save the tp points for harder battles which i ended up not summoning at allfor most of the game i complaint about the hard difficulty compared to older ff games well there is a reason when you die you are no longer thrown back to the intro screen and forced to reload the save file im suprise it took them so long to fix this dumb problem instead you just reset right back to the point before you enter the battle since you can see the enemy you can also avoid battles this is so much better than those annoy random battles in the old ff games also gils are very hard to find but thats ok because everytime you enter a battle you have full hp and no diseases there is no need to refresh your party with sleep and tents at save points none of that nonsense in ff13 and thankfully there is a savepoint every 15ish minute you play and all the cutscenese can be skipped even summons all this makes the game a hell lot less annoying to playtoo beat any enemy all you need to know is when to use the paradigm shift to buff heal stagger and inflict sadly the rest is autoattack i do miss those legacy spells like ultima which only the boss can cast in ff13 on the other hand the battle system lets you chain combos like thunder fire blizzard in one attack which is pretty cool sometimes i wonder why they couldnt let you control all three character if all you going to do is hit the autoattack most of the time the actual fighting is far better than any ff game before it you can throw monsters into the air while the other characters cast different spells on them your party members are constantly jumping flipping and moving around the area weapons enchanting spells look really cool like a slash of fire lighting or ice the ff13 battle system is a good modern approach to the old ff games which is outdated old and boring compared to modern games i say it is a better battle system compared to older ff games but then it could have been much betterthe storytelling is another important aspect in ff ff13 is extremely confusing they use weird and unconventional  names like lcie falcie pulse focus cocoon orphan etc on top of that they dont clearly define what the name actually mean where they came from and what their purpose is in ff7 when they say the shinra corporation develops makopower you know exactly what they are talking about after i beat ff13 i had to find a youtube video to explain the whole story the overall story when i understood it was just okay ff13 story is not as good as ff7 though but at least the ending in ff13 was intense and the cgi was topnotch there are also a lot of text data in ff13 that explains everything from the spells and abilities to the story itself but who has time to sit down and read all thatff132 and lightning return was already released and reviewed when i beat ff13 i played a bit of ff132 and watched reviews of lightning returns sadly the 13 series seems to be going down the drain when i play ff132 and watch the review for lightning returns they look like beta versions of ff13 i recommend ff13 but it is really pushing for that 5star since 5stars because i am an old ff fan and ff13 is not all that bad despite the flaws you still should appricate the limitless artwork cgi music and soundtrack that they put together unfortunately i will probably skip the other two follow up games in the 13 series due to the degraded game quality and continue playing where i last left off in the last of us which i have been putting on hold because of ff13',\n",

great and do a little comparison for you and explain exactly why 13 failed to stack up in nearly all of them  the top categories not necessarily valued in this order are storyline and characters graphics musical score and the overall gameplay experiencestoryline and characters  quite possibly the most important factor of any good rpg  this is the makeorbreak of a good game and quite possibly makes up for at least in my opinion most other shortcomings a game may contain  7 is arguably the breadwinner here as every character was extremely well developed likable and even sephiroth became an icon of villainy in video game history 8 pushed the boundaries with its them of love and character relationship and depth 13 however fails to live up to expectations and for this very reason loses a star from a perfect 5i hope i wasnt the only person confused by the opening chapter  unexplained plot points where shot out at rapidfire to the point where i think my brain started dodging and thereby probably missing a few things  it does unravel quite a bit later on but still leaves one scratching their head wondering just what the hell the falcie are what the relationship is to the lcie and what the heck is a cieth sp  not to mention all the names are so similar that if they rattle them all off in one sentence your eyes start spinningever heard that phrase about first impressions oh yes it really does apply here  to make it easy ill break it down by characterlightning our notsofeminine robogunblade wielding leading protagonist starts with a bit of mystery  who is she what is she doing here how does she manage such acrobatic feats sporting that miniskirt as our plot thickens or thins rather i found her less interesting as time progressed  she started out like cloud all rough and tough and kind of a lonewolf  then much unlike her spikyhaired predecessor she fell in line with the other characters and to me felt rather generic as heroines gosnow lovestruck chump seems appropriate for this knucklehead  being the leader of your own jpop rock band turned prissy freedomfighting soldier group must have knocked his iq down a few notches  be prepared to listen to we gotta save insert stuff here  the stuff in question you can typically fill in with sarah coccoon or any of the 6 main characters  hes so damned optimistic he fills his own glass over the brim and even to the optimists out there he can get on your nervessazh one of my favorites out of the whole bunch  this guntoting oldtimer actually seems to be the most down to earth character of the bunch  hes more of a realist and less of a pessimist than he seems with an understandable emotional background one can at least relate to  the chocobo is cute and all and could have been omitted entirely yet is good for a few chuckleshope  for the first half of the game i just wanted to backhand this kid  if i wanted to listen to whining id turn on mtv  thankfully he grows a pair later onfang i actually kind of liked her  smart tough least annoying voice actor she almost had it all  she falls short a bit in depth howevervanille the paragon of flakiness the epitome of ditz our scantilyclad mentally challenged pinkhaired disaster of a character and dear god why did they make her the narrator of our story is a disappointment and a travesty elevating the bar for any other undesirable character in any ff game to a level reserved for the likes of cloud yes even that bigtongued thing from 9 you know the oneall in all the storyline was fairly generic at its base with a few twists which are quite predictable  however for the sake of readers ill spare the details and let you play ongraphics very impressive  leave it to squeenix to push any given system above and beyond its designers expectations of their own hardware which will most likely trigger some red rings o death for the xbox 360 version  stunning visuals character models with believable emotions environments and monsters really make the experience memorable  its no avatar but its on par as far as video games gomusical score nobuo uematsu where epic failure on squeenix to not retain this mans hands of god  having shed some of the classic and most familiar compositions minus the chocobo theme the game falls flat on its face in terms of music  the only notable mention is leona lewis my hands which gets played only once during the game and is muted and spoken over  made for a great commercial thoughwant to argue the point fine  name one song or part of the score you couldnt get out of your head after playing the game other than the obvious chocobo theme  cant can you  now lets compare 6s aria de mezzo carattere 7s one winged angel or 8s liberi fatali  it becomes even more painful to realize that the only memorable song in the game comes from and outside source however talented ms lewis isoverall gameplay  after having mashed the x button for the first 23 hours i developed a lingering dreadful thought that the combat would not improve  that and my thumb was starting to cramp  then i was introduced to the paradigm system of combat and was not impressed  relying upon the l1 button and x button for all of your combat needs gets rather boring and repetitious to the point where it draws away from higher brain functions  although it is to be expected from a console ff game  later on it does become necessary to alternate between paradigms and take the time to figure out which sets work best with what characters however youll most likely find yourself with a set pattern to follow in combat with this exact character set at the end of your first playthrough lightning hope and snowfangthis is mostly due to the way in which the characters are developed which is sad to say rather linear despite being appearing so open towards the end  at first character development is kept in line to play on a characters base expectations then the tree expands quite a bit later  however youve already developed your characters into their own roles at the point which you can diverge into other practices it seems to be rather futile and costly to do so leaving you only with the logical choice to remain on said characters chosen path  its like changing departments at your job only to realize youve forfeit any future benefits squandered your good fortunes on new office supplies and its dawned on you that you cant go back to your old cubicle and cant get a refund on that shiny new stapleri found myself arguing with the camera a bit which was for the most part cooperative  it was also very nice for once to be the only ff characters not to be impeded by a fallen log in their path due to their advanced training in acrobatics and ninja techniques apparentlyso with the games predictable generic plot overall poor character depth unmemorable score simplistic gameplay yet stunning visuals and effects i can only pray 13 versus is an improvement or i can look forward to dedicating more years of my life with a

       " 'a great many reviews have called this game a great game but a mediocre final fantasy title but this is deceptive while there is no doubt that this is a mediocre ff title its also a mediocre game in almost every respect worse still this game will probably sound the final death knell for the japanese role playing game dubbed jrpgits been a strange ride for both ffxiii and the jrpg in general without summarizing the great past of the jrpg however it is safe to say that it has not found its niche in this generation particularly on the ps3 where jrpgs have both been scarce and hard sells thats not to say there havent been solid titles eternal sonata tales of vesperia and star ocean have all been quite good but the american rpg has just been significantly better both critically and commerciallybut this was the one that would change all that right well not exactlyremember that ff xiii was supposed to be the title that would save the poorperforming ps3 announced years ago as one of the hot ticket exclusives people would buy the system just to play this game or so the story wentbut some curious things happened along the way first the title was delayed again and again for an extended period square wouldnt even hint at a release date then in a shot heard round the fanboy world square announced that ff xiii would in fact be multiplatform the sony fanboys squealed the xbox devotees delightedbut the ps3 found its legs with cheaper and better models and topnotch exclusives like uncharted 2 and finally years after its announcement ff xiii was releasedand so we come to the biggest problem with the game this feels like a launch title if this had been released in 2007 or 2008 it might have made serious waves im sure its graphical quality would have wowed the masses and probably overcome its woefully boring gameplay but its 2010 no one is amazed by a prerendered fireworks scene no matter how many times you show it around 5 incidentally weve seen uncharted 2 and the fact is these graphics dont improve on that game in the least heck the movies hardly feel better than metal gear solid 4 and that was released two years agoits hard to point out anything exceptional about the game once you fail to be amazed by the graphics the biggest praise has usually been handed out to the socalled paradigm system and indeed there was much potential here the problem is that the system is easy to master and the game inexplicably introduces way too much chance into the proceedings you can have a party with 5 paradigms that you really like only to have the game mysteriously change your party around before a big battle you have no chance to reconfigure paradigms so youre stuck with whatever you are given lamebattles come in two flavors easy and cheap since you can switch paradigms on the fly and there is no mp measurement in the game you can essentially use an attacking paradigm for every battle when your party starts to get hurt  and this is key people so listen  you switch to ahealing paradigm then when you are healed up you switch back ltgasps people who claim a great strategy in this game have obviously never played a game requiring strategythis works for around 99 of the battles but every now and then you just get cheaped as i mentioned above sometimes the computer will randomly change the makeup of your party and force you into a battle with a difficult foe say bahamut you are then required to react quickly enough to discern all of your new paradigms and pick an appropriate one before he slaughters you which happens after around two attacks of course it would be simplistic if you could just have chosen your own paradigms but thats not possible because of the random switchan even more egregious example is the stop spell bosses occasionally cast during the battle with the final boss all of my party members were hit with stop simultaneously i had to sit and wait it out the problem i died before the spell ended what a jokethe item creation system is a joke in order to get some items you must first find another item upgrade it and then dismantle it there is absolutely no rhyme or reason to which items you should do this for eg i obtained the sprint shoes which cast haste on a character from dismantling a tetradic tiara which casts protect veiland pretty much everything else except haste what a joke upgrading is laughable there are something like 100 components in the game but they all do exactly the same thing add experience to your weaponaccessory thus a bomb core will do just was murky ooze does why even put all of these different components into the game oh right  to make it look like the developers actually did somethingthe story of this game is pretty weak and the character interactions are a laugh riot most of the game deals with a lot of existentialist hoohah about freedom of choice even as it is clear that the characters dance on puppet strings for the entire game the end of the game is just baffling with a lame boss to boot and the best part expect to hear such rich lines as i wanted to tell the truth but i was afraid people wouldnt like me i think afterschool specials were written better than thistheres plenty of other things to rail on about battles are too long the game is too linear with zero exploration etc but i think ive made the point it begs the question why did square need so long to develop this title the graphics are nice but they hardly wow the gameplay is linear and the design is lazy the sad part of it is that while this game will assuredly sell pretty well the fact that it is the first ff title for this generation is more than enough to convince people to buy it it will no doubt hurt the overall market for jrpgs this is not a game to get excited about this is a game that you buy and play only to convince yourself that you didnt waste 60thumbs down',\n",

       " 'finally after what seems like an eternity the long awaited final fantasy 13 was in my handssadly it was over in a few short weeks but while it lasted it was funi was put off my negative reviews before playing but i was always going to buy it and it turned out to be a great experience the usual stereotypes apply of course as you watch a band of earnest fighters strive to change the world and stop an unstoppable power from destroying everythinglets get down to basics how does it feel to play well the reviews are right in that for a lot of the time you simply run from point a to point b and fight monsters along the way this seems like the formula for a very large portion of the game as a whole and most of it under an atmosphere of urgency i seem to remember every chapter seemed to be about some chase or law and order disruption or mass outbreak of violence with very little lull in the action sounds great but the palette of an adventure needs light and shadesame problem as the film advent children hadafter a while i was just mechanically bashing my way through enemy fodder without a clue as to what my goal was apart from winning each fight and i have to say this is a drawback of the game in general right from the start i recalled a review that said play it for the storyplay it for the story what story this was one simple dash through a precarious situation which basically involved being hunted by the authorities while simultaneously hoping to solve the mystery of what happens to people who get marked with a mysterious brand and either end up turning into crystal or becoming monsters and here we get another problemthe plot hinges on you knowing understanding terms like lcie falcie pulse gran pulse pulse lcie cieth the terminology is hideous i was totally bewildered about 70 of the time which really didnt help me engage with the storyanyway on to the important part which is the battles here the game redeems itself pretty well you have a team of three active fighters out of a total of six and the battles are fairly dynamic although they are very much turn based a bit confusing as in ff10 your characters zip around the battlefield but its all just eye candy as when its the enemies turn to hit you will suffer damage regardless of whether they are on top of you or if you seem to be 100 meters away just to reiterate you cant control characters movements you just input commands so all the lively leaping about on screen is automatic each character has an atb and you can cue commands up and then when the atb is full the commands will be dished out now you can only control one character at a time which i found a bit disappointing i had come to this after playing star ocean the last hope and that game has a great system of changing character control mid battle which this would have benefitted from as it stands you only ever control the party leader and the other two are on auto pilotthe way the fighting is really controlled is the paradigm shift system which i thought sounded like a chore before i started but in fact its the most important part of fighting strategy basically you have a bunch of skills healer magic attacks physical attacks guarding and so on and you make sets of three 2 attackers and a healer two healers and a guard etc and this is how you control the action you have to prepare these outside of battle so that when fighting starts you have a set of strategies ready so the fight might start with one attacker one healer and one status enhancer and then whenever you see an opening youll swap the strategy to all three attacking swapping back to three guards when you see the enemy charging for a big attack now controlling the paradigms is absolutely key to winning and you have to be quick as the battles in this game are fast whats great is that the ai is perfect put your team on attackhealdebuff and the other two team mates will do the right thing 100 of the time  they seem to know what will help you most or hinder the enemy most they cure you of nasty afflictions straight away and go straight for the enemy weakness as soon as it is identified you might think this is a bit simple but its not the fights are not easy well they start off fairly easy but towards the end they change quite steeplythere are a few great enhancements too after every battle you are completely healed this is a fantastic idea as it means you dont limp crippled through long dungeons waiting for a healing spot or somewhere to buy items also magic is unlimited in battle  again a great idea as i used to hate using magic because it would run out  not any more there are also precious few items in the battle menu  mainly just potions and phoenix downs  no items that cause damage or status ailments all this stuff comes from commandsas i said most of these seemingly simplifying enhancements are actually vital to the game as fighting is hard  buffing up and weakening the enemy is far more important that i used to think i nearly always went into regular battle with a buffer and a debuffer in my opening paradigm towards the end of the game the bosses are good too suitably impressive however ill add another negative here the summons they serve no purpose at all  i used them all once to see the cool animations but never touched them after thatthe game does finally go freeroaming in its final stages and its one of the best parts of the whole experience when the characters arrive at a large rural expanse and its huge suddenly you can go anywhere you want and the freedom is a breath of fresh air the seemingly only side mission in the game now appears where you can hunt for marks that is minibosses which can be incredibly tough even some of the random monsters in the open area are toughi saw a big dog like thing soon after arriving and though ah he looks tough time for some power levelling  well he totally flattened me in seconds yes the open area is full of enemies that you have no hope of beating on your first arrival they are just there to be looked at and run past much much later i came back and pasted that big dog it was a king behemoth by the way into oblivion where it belonged but it took a long time to get to that stagebut even with this vast open area the game still feels quite linear the levelling up is disguised as a chart where you can allocate points to your chosen strengths on a big grid but its just one continuous path so youre only really advancing in one direction at all times the weapon upgrade system is also very tiresome all through the game you get various weapons and accessories  but i started upgrading mine straight away thinking i would be able to trade up in some way later onhowever every weapon you find starts out at level 1 which means that you cant discard your early efforts for something better  they all start off as weak as dishwater i wasted a ton of synth materials on my very first weapons for all the characters and then had to start all over again when i got other types that i thought might be betterand the synth materials are scarce and expensive i wish i had known this but i resigned myself later on to the realisation that on a single playthrough you can really only pick one weapon per character if you want to upgrade it to any decent degree still i ended up with some stuff that was not bad but the synthesizing and upgrading system is not well explained at allso i think i will summarize nowgraphicsamazing to look at the cut scenes are especially good even the menus are stunning to look atmusic pretty good although no set piece them tunes or songs i can take or leave the leona lewis balladactingvery good although vanille the chirpy one starts to grate occasionallystoryhmm it seems to me that very little happens and this was really pushed in the previews for the game but i found it very weak and mostly confusingbattlesa big yes here although is it just me or was the final boss fight a bit ordinaryvarietynope there is not a lot of points for this no towns or shops only one side quest no enhanced second game very regimented character development aftergame activity is limited to an opportunity to carry on from the point just before the last boss and return to the main world to get even strongerjust to beat the optional minibosses i guessso i have to say i did really enjoy the game but in hours of devoted play this was a short ff game for me however i was please with the fact that i unlocked some really cool wallpapers by playing it',\n",

       " 'edit in retrospect i upgraded the game to 4stars once you can get past the unmercifully slow pacing of the first 30 hours eg once you get to gran pulse the game starts to get fun the review comments stand and i still give it 35 stars but would rather round up than down in this caseoriginal postafter 75 hours i finally finished ffxiii in short stunning graphics great voice acting but pacing killed the story and gameplay a good way to think about this game is to think of it like lord of the rings very slow in some areas but very rewarding when it finally begins to explain whats going onthe biggest flaw in this game had to do with the pacing it was a complex story with a lot of threads from the start that isnt a problem in fact its a good thing but the character development happens so slowly that you really dont get a chance to want to start caring about the characters i didnt care about the characters until i was already almost 35 hours into the game this is due to the fact that character development happens exclusively in cut scenes as opposed to conversations you initiate which is the case with other ff games also the fact that you dont really get to explore until chapter 11 which is about 35 hours into the game means that the vast majority of the game is comprised of a long hallway with an orange spot at the end of it indicating either an enemy or a cut scene thereby giving rise to the nickname passages and cut scenes the gamestill if youre a fan of ff games its worth a try if for no other reason than to enjoy the beautiful graphics the fact that you can play the vast majority of the game with one finger just keep pressing x youll be fine is debatable as a weakness personally i rather enjoyed being able to watch shows on my computer while playing the game especially in parts where i was mostly farming for money or pointsanyway heres my breakdown story 1 out of 10 7 out of 10 if we ignore the pacing as for the story itself unless you pay close attention to the clues in the story the ending will have you thinking what the heck just happened yes the pacing is that bad and it causes problems through the entire game i lay it squarely no pun intended on the shoulders of character development happening exclusively in cut scenes rather than in playerinitiated conversations the pacing was so bad that 30 hours into it i almost dropped the game after finishing it im very glad i didnt gameplay 6 out of 10 and its mostly due to pacing inconsistencies the fighting system itself is pretty good and you can choose how involved you want it to be do you want to choose every move or do you want to let the computer decide the best course of action but pacing oh pacing the vast majority of the game is pretty comfortable to get through not too easy but not too hard then at the end wham it becomes super hard even for a super powered character and i farmed for experience points for hours plus did major upgrades on my weapons so it wasnt a me issue ironically it isnt the boss fights which are hard its the regular enemies i dont mind hard fights but inconsistencies are annoying graphics 11 out of 10 yes they were that stunning make that a 12 out of 10 since this was the only thing at times that kept me playing the game is gorgeous the extra 2 points are for keeping me playing music 8 out of 10 not memorable but certainly not bad it fulfilled the most important role of theatrical scores ambiance without getting in the way during fights i rarely noticed the music this is a good thing i only really noticed it when it was fitting within the story this again is a good thing value 9 out of 10 one cool feature for those of us who get all obsessive about completing every single thing and getting the absolute most out of the game is that you can go back to the game after you finish it and complete all the side quests you may have missed you get a chance to save your progress after the credits thats a nice little bit of extra value and just about the only real exploration you get to do in the game the keyword here is value i wish more rpgs did this heck i wish i got to do this with ffx i really liked blitzball the 9 out of 10 is taking into consideration the aftergame playability which can go on for as long as youd like in fact the game took me about 75hrs to finish and i can see myself playing for at least another 30 if i decided to undertake all the sidequests and the upgrade paths the only knock is that you have to trudge through the game for too long before you finally get to the fun partso taking all these scores into consideration 5 categories for 50 points total the game gets 36 points 161289 thats a solid 71 or 7 out of 10 35 stars out of 5 is more amazonian  would i recommend it to certain people but certainly not to everyone',\n",

       " 'i played final fantasy xiii when it first came out  i rented it from block buster and i was not impressed  i went into the game with an entire set of preconceived notions about what a final fantasy game is supposed to be and xiii was a huge disappointment that i found myself unable to get into  after returning the game i put it out of my mind and went on to other games demons souls valkyria chronicles dungeon defenders etc  i didnt miss the game or the franchise and had convinced myself that i would never buy another ff gameone day while browsing amazon i commented to my wife that i would buy this game if i ever found it for 10 bucks  i just happened to check back that night before bed and it was priced at 999 with prime shipping  crap  when the game finally arrived my response was hohum  what the hell  its been awhile maybe ill give it another go  i had deleted my save files from before as i had no intention of ever playing the game againandits not that badthe game is a spiritual successor to where final fantasy xii left off  the combat system is similar  paradigm is a longer more fancy name for gambit and a lot of the more complicated tasks that give players control in ff games have been taken out  for example while you can choose individual spells and attacks for your main character you have no control whatsoever over your other party members except through the manipulation of paradigms  that being said once you get used to the paradigm system its actually kind of fun  there is an element of strategy involved in that you can set up what roles your support characters take  also while you can choose individual skills and spells for your main character its usually better to just press x and let the game auto battle as it will usually choose the most effective spellsskills against the monster you are currently fightingthe voice acting is average  fortunately there isnt really a tidus type voice actor who drove me insane in ffx but vanilles accent is all over the place and her personality is that of a ten year old  many of the characters seem to have pauses in conversations where they shouldnt and laugh about things that dont make all that much sense but ill just assume that its hard for the japanese to write american humorthe story itself gets more and more compelling as you progress although there are times i cant figure out why the hell a cut scene was made other than to keep me from actually playing for an extra minute or two  at times you run into gauntlets of cut scenes right before a major boss battle along with a character you were not previously able to use being introduced to your party hence your paradigms are all jacked up and you die a horrible miserable death  fortunately much as i hate to enjoy this feature the game offers a handy retry feature instead of kicking you back to your last save point although if you have a 10 month old son make sure he doesnt eject your disc while youre playingtheres a not a lot of freedom of movement either  you progress down a linear path almost forever lets say 90 of the game  theres not all that much freedom of character development either  your characters do not level in the traditional sense  instead you receive points to use in the crystarium menu where you teach your characters new skills in a once again highly linear path  once you reach a certain point in the game youll be able to teach your characters different roles if they dont already know them in whatever order you want but the actual crystarium path is pretty set with little room for individualitythe bottom lineif you approach this game as an old school final fantasy title you will probably be disappointed  the graphics are great the combat system and character development is kind of annoying but alright the story itself is a bit more confusing than it needs to be at times disjointed and difficult to get into and the characters personalities annoy me  sometimes i feel like this is a final fantasy self help video game designed to boost the self esteem of tweens and teens  almost everyone is over the top positive and even those who are negative are converted into beaming rays of optimistic sunshine  you really have to stick with this one  a friend of mine said it fairly well you dont really start having fun until after you beat it  what  if you want to play it probably wait til its 15 bucks or less and then do the same for ff xiii2 which shouldnt be that hard since the story is hard to get into anyway',\n",

       " 'sigh  so so disappointedso first let me say i consider myself somewhat of a veteran jrpg gamer  played final fantasy 78910 final fantasy tactics final fantasy tactics advance advance a2 xenogears legend of legaia breath of fire etc etc  ive been out of the jrpg scene for a while and decided to try to return with square enixs the last remnant which was a horrible game  still wanting a good jrpg adventure i got a ps3 and got final fantasy 13  i was so so excited to start  oklets get to it  this review will not have spoilers  gonna start off with the shorter list which are the prosprosmusic  never thought id say it but nobuo uematsu has been bested  the music in final fantasy xiii is the best of them all  the music is strong emotional and fits well  one thing i like to is that the battle theme changes in certain areas so its not always the same  seriousy though the music is incredible and is one of the reasons why im giving this game two starsvisuals  final fantasy 13 uses the full power of the ps3  when i was playing the game at some times i would just stop and look around the scenery  near the beginning of the game at lake bresha it really highlights how amazing the visuals and music are  seriously this game is absolutely gorgeouscons  wow where to beginbattle system  the battle system is a new fresh system in real time  my complaints are as followsyou only control one character in the team  this removes sooooooooo much strategy in the game  the ai control the other two characters and you better hope they cast the spell or do the move you want  seriously want to heal your main character over a secondary character  better hope the ai algorithm tells it to heal you or else good luck  you change how the ai acts by switching roles in a paradigm shift  the battle system seriously is boring  the pace of the battle pushes you to always select auto battle in nearly 99 of the fights  even on boss fights i would just browse reddit while pressing x every 10 seconds  square enix tried make it interesting but they seriously ruined it  fights which are practically the whole game mentioned why later in the review are absolutely boring  also included is the eidlon system which are the summons in ffxii  pretty much pointless except to delay a doom counter  not to mention they ruined some of the beloved summonsshiva is a motorcycle for examplewtfcharacters and dialog  i have no idea how they messed up so bad  near the beginning its relevant how bad the dialog is gonan be were heroesyeaaa yeaa heroes are you kidding me  there really is no main protaganist  lightning appears to be it but she has nearly no character development whatsoever  even after finishing the game i feel i dont know her at all  vanille has more character development then  now se does try to develop thembut they try sooo hard that its laughable  minor scenes literally lasting 5 seconds seems to inspire the characters to act for the next 30 hours  they tried so hard that it became humor  the writing and characters are just plain bad  now lightning vanille hope fang and sazh are cooland they really really had potential but se just didnt develop themplot  the plot is just all over the place  who the heck is the antangonist  ff7 it was sephiroth ff8 it was the sorceress ff9 it was alexandria ff10 it was sin  ff13no idea  they throw you right into itand you kinda have to read the plot through the datalog  weak bad guys did nothing for this gamelinearity  this is a joke  seriously the first 25 hours are going from point a to point band just grinding mobs inbetween  worthless  people talk about how the game opens up at ch 11this is a joke  they essentially release you into a huge open area in which you can run aroundbut all you do is take missions in which each one is to kill a beast  no development or anything  it is a good way to grind and makes grinding a bit betterbut its still grinding  the first 25 hours really do seem like a tutoriallack of cities  why would you remove cities  cities allow a break from the dungeon and constant mobs  i loved exploring cities in between dungeons  ffxiii  no thanks  its dungeon to dungeon to dungeon  all grinding  they had so much potential for the cities with these graphics and music  the teased us with the city of dreams nautalisi was so happy when i came to it and was able to move aroundbut alasyou cant do anythingthe grind  the game expects you to spend hours and hours of grinding  i did every fight possible up to ch 11 about 25 hours  after the game opens up the creeps get insanely harder  it did teach me how to play better but still insanely hard  and gillol  to upgrade some items you need to buy material costing over two million gil  you literally have to farm sooo damn much to collect this and remember the battles are just mashing autobattle  finallyi did farm for a few hoursdid about 12 of the hunting missions for levelingbut guess whatupon reaching the final dungeoni began to experience difficulty issues again  checked the walkthroughsand they all said you need to farm for another 2 hours  at that pointi said eff it  i wasnt gonna farm anymore  i was 3 creep waves away from the final bossbut just gave up  each of those fights in the final dungeon take about 8  10 minutes and are just mindlessoverallit feels square enix decided to just say hey lets drop everything that made our past jrpgs great and just throw in a bunch of crap  seriouslyso so bad  i ended up just watching a video walkthrough of the lastultimatelyi will follow throughwill buy final fantasy xiii2 and lightning returns at some point to finish the trilogybut in the meantime i think im just gonna download some psone classics to remember the good old daysif you are buying this game expecting a jrpgdont do it  youll just be disappointedsighstill so disappointededit 1 10252012  i still ponder on this game every once in a whileafter listenting to the soundtrack and just having the emotions from the game surge back i decided to bump up my rating from 1 star to 2 star  hard to explain whyanother plug for the ostthe final fantasy xiii soundtrack is the best of them alledit 2  32213  man the ost is still among the top played on my ipod  also realized i gave the last remnant a 25 and that game is definitely not equal to final fantasy 13  raised my score up to 35 dont ask why  60 is still a d people',\n",
       " 'final fantasy xiii  b000fq2dtafor various reasons revolving around time and money this is the first final fantasy game ive played since the ffx franchise i really likedfinal fantasy x played it several times over and still consider it to be one of the best most indepth games ive ever played so coming from that perspective i bought ffxiii on launch day something i rarely donow my opinion is this if youre like me and youre thinking about buying this right now based on your love for ffx i would recommend that you wait and rent the game first because while this game can be considered a good game in its own right its very different from ffxto start with the story telling mechanic is one that im not thrilled with its not easy creating a final fantasy world im sure and its even harder to explain this brave new world to the gamer  i get that a good deal of the ff games in the past have gotten over this hurdle by introducing a character with some kind of amnesia or memorydisconnect tidus cloud terra etc that can allow the characters to explain the plot to the gamer directly ffxiii so far prefers to instead drop a datalog entry into your menu screen after every cutscene  these datalog entries explain the plot so far all the backstory you need to know up to this point the setting the characters and so forthfor myself personally im not a fan of this alternative approach to story telling  i feel that this type of exposition breaks the flow of the game badly the gaming equivalent of having a movie cut to a director so that he can explain the backstory of the movie more thoroughly than the characters could and i also feel that the datalog entries are often confusing given that theres very little context for the information furthermore a lot of what gets dropped into the datalog could be told to you ingame but just isnt  okay so the political backstory might be hard to work in but the characterization of the main characters shouldnt be developed this way the game revolves strongly around telling rather than showing and the whole things feels very alien to the final fantasy franchise as a result i find that i do not care about these characters in the same way that i have for final fantasy characters in the past and that is incredibly disappointingsecondly theres the fighting system for myself personally i preferred the turnbased strategy style of ffx where each enemy had a weakness that one or more characters could exploit ffxiii returns to the actionbar style of fighting that i last saw in ffvii which was a minor disappointment for me i wouldnt mind this so much but for the first several hours of gameplay the game pretty much flatout tells you to mash autoattack because its faster and more accurate than trying to work out a strategy the fact that this changes later is well a good thing but i really wish it hadnt been done this way in the beginning at all  it makes me feel like the computer doesnt really need me there to play the gamethirdly although i really dont mind linearity in games i am disappointed to see that for most of the early gameplay ffxiii is literally linear  all the action has the various characters literally running down a northsouth corridor with nothing to see or interact with along the way except an obvious chest or two remember that scene in ffx where you are escaping from bevelle and then you run down a long corridor to save kimahri and fight seymour that corridor is basically the first few hours of ffxiii but with a cutscene every five minutes and another ten minutes of datalog reading after each cutscene that is not good gameplay for mei thought maybe that ffxiii was made this way to appeal to people who didnt like ffx like my husband who loves video games but thought that ffx was too heavy on story and not heavy enough on action for the first half but he isnt really drawn in by this gameplay style either i get that its experimental but its frustrating to buy a final fantasy game and find that core elements like story have been tossed out the window and landing in a data log apparentlyso now ive written all that and im afraid that ill have made people upset by judging ffxiii against ffx and im not doing that i can how a lot of people could like this game in its own right and i highly encourage everyone to try it and see if they like it with the assumption that they probably will the only reason im making the ffx comparisons is to let people know that if youre rushing out to buy this on launch week on the strength of your feelings for ffx you may get a different game that what youre expecting if youre a rabid ffx fan like myself i recommend renting before you buy  youll may end up buying anyway but its good to be sure what with this tight economy ana mardoll',\n",

       " 'this is an early review of my first impressions of the game i have played all of the english final fantasy games released in the us to date and unlike a lot of people i actually enjoyed final fantasy ix and liked final fantasy x more than final fantasy vii and i am a big advocate for extremely challenging 100 turnbased battles which is why i love final fantasy x your tastes may differ so you should take everything i say with a grain of saltto start with final fantasy xiii reminds me a little bit of final fantasy vii crisis core in the design of the menu frames save points and ridiculously oversimplified gameplay mechanics there is not a whole lot you can do during battles in this game you only really control one character and the cpu attempts to mimic competent strategy for your group mates depending on their assigned roles you cannot tweak the strategies like most jrpgs with similar concepts ie tales of xyz star ocean etci really hope square returns to turnbased games in the future final fantasy x had the perfect battle system swapping members in and out strategically using skills to delay enemy turns and unlimited time to think about strategy as a result the game was much harder and much more rewarding unfortunately now we are stuck with the majority of new jrpgs using mindless uninteresting buttonmashing battle systemsthat said i do like how you can change roles on the fly in final fantasy xiii that almost makes up for the game not being truly turnbased in my book the only redeeming quality would be if they had a new game mode where the battles are significantly harder unfortunately new game seems to have died when the psx bit the dust final fantasy x2 had it but a game that bad requires new game to convince someone to even consider playing it a second time if they even finish it a first timewhat is more although i read numerous places that the game is very linear it never quite hit home what they meant frankly for a jrpg to have a compelling story it needs to be linear i cannot name a single jrpg that boasted about nonlinear gameplay that was even halfway decent eg the abomination known as final fantasy x2 but in this game your character advancement is capped between story elementsalthough it may look like your progress on the crystalium grid allows you to customize the development of your characters the number of branches in the path are extremely limited again final fantasy xs remarkably similar character advancement system was far more dynamic and strategic while waiting for the next major story element to occur which unlocks new stages in the crystalium tree you will have racked up enough cp to completely fill the crystalium tree for all of your roles and then somethe story seems decent at the moment but i have my doubts about the replayability of this game i may only be compelled to play the game multiple times to try and earn 1000 gamerscore in the xbox 360 version and trophies in the ps3 versionon a final note it is nice to see the datalog concept being used more often in games like star ocean and xenosaga the plethora of information available in their dictionaries made the story much more engaging in star oceans case it helped alleviate some of the boringness of unchallenging twitchaction realtime battles and in xenosaga it helped make sense of the very long cutscenes that took place everytime you walked more than 5 feetoverall i have enjoyed the game so far  it has not moved me the way that final fantasy x did from the very first hour of gameplay on but it also has not driven me to regret my purchase like final fantasy x2 did   45 out of 5 points lost due to unchallenging actionbased battle system final fantasy xiis gambit system made up for this flaw but final fantasy xiii lacks any sort of complex strategic element',\n",

       " 'for many rpg fans this game was longed for from the time we first heard it was in production it was a reason to get a playstation 3 when it was said it would only be out for that machine however with all that anticipation the actual game was a kind of a letdown i think that final fantasy 13 actually suffers from being so anticipated it is an average to good turned based jrpg but being a final fantasy game i think many pepole had expected more i know i sure didfinal fantasy 13 had a rather ok story it is set in a sort of futuristic world where the huge city of cocoon is being protected and ruled by machine gods known as falcie now these creatures sometimes choose to bestow magickal abilities on human beings making them into lcie servants of sort that the machine gods give a mission to called a focus now a lcie never know exactly what his or her focus is and there is a time limit if the focus is not completed by then the unfortunate lcie will turn into a ravaging monster if they manage to complete their focus then they are turned to crystal so it is kind of a looseloose situation in addition pepole generally fear lcie especially those from pulse the land below the floating and protected city of cocoon in fact pepole fear pulse so much that when a pulse falcie is discovered in cocoon in the start of the game the corrupt and totalitarian government decides to banish all the pepole living in those areas of the city effectively killing them it is this event battling to stop pepole from being banished or just to stay alive in the start of the game that bring the main characters togethernow off course the main characters rather quickly become lcie and the game is mostly about them trying to survive while at the same time finding a way to control their own destiny instead of having various forces decide for them the story is rather interesting and i will not give to much of it away here however the problem is that there is to little story compared to to much grinding fighting and general game play the story is so important in a computer rpg but i feel that in ff 13 it get pushed to the side for combat something which really do not work to well since the combat system is horribleah yes the combat system this game is one of those semi real time things now this point in my review is just personal preference but for me semi real time do not really do it for me i want either to have the time to think up strategy of a turned based game or the more realistic action of a real time combat game however i have seen good semi real time combat systems this is not one of them basically the game bases itself on having various paradigms or attack patterns if you will and game play is mostly about changing these around for best effect for example you might start a battle with a paradigm where the characters cast spells to add bonuses to your character or weaken the enemy and then shift to all out attack and then over to a healing paradigm when the party is getting low on health now there are some problems with this one is that the system is hard to get into but one you get it there is so little involvement from the player it is just press button shift paradigm press button shift paradigm constantly it get very monotonous after a while another problem is that in the start of the game the party constantly split up meaning that the paradigms you usually use do not work and you have to grind allot to build up the characters enough to get usable paradigms so you can make it past a section where you might just have two characters to work with the system is boring needlessly complicated and unsuited to large parts of the gamenow for the graphics the character graphics are breathtaking they are so realistically made the facial expressions are just perfect the character design is beautiful to bad the rest of the game is not as good now the animation and level design is always theatrically good the problem is that in large parts of the game the areas are so bland you can program a gray wall masterfully but it is still a gray wall there is also very little variety when it comes to the enemies and in a game where there is so much grinding this becomes a problem the bosses to usually is not that impressive they are perfectly animated but they are boring to look at or is something one have seen a million times before technically i would give the games graphics 10 out of 10 but it often fails in the art department to say it like thatnow many have complained that this game is to linear i honestly have no problem with a linear game i do not need there to be multiple endings and all that to enjoy myself but this game at times is not just linear with the story in the first part of the game you literary just walk in corridors this gets better halfway through the game but before then you can not even wander of to explore different rooms you just walk along the path grind walk and grind and walk some more then it do not help that the games environment is created technically goodyou have six characters in this game lighting is the chick on the front cover she is an ex soldier and is your typical though girl then you have snow and idealistic freedom fighter vanille the required cute girl fang another though girl but a bit more feminine this time hope a young boy there always have to be a child in jrpgs it seams and then there is sazh a pessimistic father looking for his son that have a baby chocobo living in his afro the characters are interesting and well developed but hell do they whine in most final fantasy games the characters experiences bad things often they are put in emotionally difficult situations or seam to have no hope of survival and there is often deep emotions and that is fine it is part of what makes final fantasy good one starts to care about the characters however in this game there is hardly a cut scene without one or more of the characters on their knees on the ground crying their despair to the sky and mourning their cruel fate now i understand that it is not particularly funny to have the future prospect of either becoming a monster or a crystal but seriously auron from final fantasy 10 is dead and tidus dont really exist but somehow they manage to not behave like a emo on speedthe voice acting for this game at least the english that we had on while playing through it is fine in fact every technical aspect of this game is great that is why i give it 3 stars the story is good and the technical qualities of the game is better than in any other jrpg i have ever played i am sure fans of jrpg and fantasy games in general will enjoy this however the game is not up to part with other final fantasy games i was disappointed in it it is a middle of the three to good game but that is not what i expect from a ff game it is clearly one of the weaker games in the franchise now i really hate one to five stars it is so hard to give an correct opinion with only five but if this was one to then i would give the game about seven it is good you will enjoy it but it is not good enough for final fantasy',\n",

doesnt make sense to me how people can say this is a bad game or worst game in the series  dont get it while i understand where they are coming from they also have to understand that not all games can be the same of course when a new seriesbased game comes out youre looking for it to be the same  yet better than the previous one it cant be that way all the timepersonally i love this game i cant say its my favorite final fantasy because it truly isntbut in no way will i say this game is terrible and disgraces the final fantasy name  because it doesnti dont compare games to each other because really its not fair at all to me it feels like youre not appreciating the game itself rather just saying its better or worse than its predecessor i look at what the game personally has to offer not what it didnt have that others didbut anyways ill start with the storystorythe story in whole is interesting yet boring at times that come quite too often but im not the type of gamer that will put a game down because its boring i give the game time to recoup or regain my interest which it did even though it is boring some times it does still remain its interesting plot the story is told in a nice way although confusing sometimes i guess until you get to the end i like how the game has movie scenes every so often because i like a good story and not many games have such in depth story lines anymore so i personally liked iti never felt like i was actually in the game but it was amusing watching the cut scenes and i really liked the characters relationship with one another and how they talked to each other and all that it made me feel happy for some reason that they all were getting along or having fun  or something but to me the story is pretty much the same as always but it is told in an interesting way and i liked it very much  especially the endingcharactersok so the characters themselves are pretty nice they all have nice personalities and such its 6 playable characters lightning snow sazh vanille hope and fang and a nonplayable character that the story pretty much revolves around serah my favorite character is sazh and then probably hope and vanille now i read that lightnings character was modeled after cloud strife from ffvii i didnt know that at first but it really wasnt done well at all what i mean by this is even though cloud was the silent type he still had a lot of dialogue in the game or at least i think he did even if it was  but lightning on the other hand its not necessarily her character but its the way they implement her into the game shes supposed to be the main character but has little less than 20 of the dialogue in the whole gameshe talks of course when spoken to but they hardly speak to her within the whole game while i dont personally have a problem with it it is a bit weird seeing as the character fang who comes in way too far in the story makes for a better main character than lightning and she comes into the game halfway through but like i said i dont personally care i just find it strangepeople say that the character vanille is way too cheery and annoying while i could agree i dont find her that cheery or annoyingto me shes just a selphie or a rikku she has her ups and her downs and her ups are usually fronts  youll understand all soon enough but personally i never found fault with her or any of the characters reallygameplaythis is basically what has this game thrown overboard but wait its not because the gameplay is bad its because reviewers and critics have made it bad saying that it has super linear gameplay as if its some monstrous demonic sesame street characteri can say that the game doesnt have big open areas that branch out into different areas at every which way but soif you look at other games such as ffx its no different at all there was only one way down mihhen highroad and only one way up mtgagazet whats the problem well there isnt one really the only things that this game doesnt have though im not comparingare towns in which you can go to shop or take quests or whateveryou can shop of course but ill get to that later so there is no balamb no luca its just field basicallywhile there are towns in the game they arent the same as other games they put you into towns but theres really only 1 way to go and there arent any merchants or no shopping district or anything its strictly storyline when they put you into a townbut i dont have a problem with it because its just the way the game is made even though its not like i dont have problems with any game because its just the way its madepeople say the game opens up at chapter 11 and in the endgame area what this means is  without ruining the story  that at chapter 11 you go from cocoon to gran pulse cocoon is a world floating in the sky visible from gran pulse as like a moon and gran pulse is the giant wildlifefilled outer world and so at chapter 11 you go to gran pulse and the areas there are open even though its not that many different places you can go to for me its still enough and at the end of the game chapter 13 there are portals in which you can revisit 2 places gran pulse and another place within cocoon even though the game only pretty much has story and hunt quests its not like the game is empty i still have fun farming for moneycp exp equivalent probably because this is the first console game where i actually had to farm but anyways i still find it fun hunting all the monsters i think its about 64 or 63 marks in total but when you start getting to around 4050 its when you really start having to farm and get a little stronger so its coolbattlein a way battle has been changed in this game i say in a way because itss still atb like ffx2 but its differentnow how it is is you play only with the party leader and the other 2 characters are played by the ai dont worry they are played pretty well even though they can only use abilities not techniques or items so you end up having to use potions to help them after so long but anyways your character has an atb gauge you start the game off with 2 bars 1 skill uses about 1 bar but more advanced skills may use 2 or 3 at times in the story you gain an atb gauge the max you get from completing the story is 5 but their ultimate weapon gives you 1 more so a total of 6 but its costlyhard to get an ultimate weapon so youll have 5 for a good majority of the timethe battle pretty much becomes battle when you have to switch paradigms paradigms are like templates of roles a role is like medic or commando or sentinel or whatever there are 6 roles in total anyways a paradigm is when you choose what roles the 3 characters in your party will use example a paradigm that consists of commando ravager ravager can be switched to in battle you can set up to a total of 6 paradigms but can always change themdelete them in the main menu when out of battlethe battle isnt won by attacking or using a spell though a key to winning is to fill an enemies chain gauge and stagger ita chain gauge is this enemies have a bar chain gauge and every time you attack the enemy the gauge fills ravagers build the chain gauge fast as its a passive ability they have but the chain gauge will decrease as fast as it increased if only a ravager is attacking commandos can slower the time it decreases by attacking the same enemy as the ravager saboteurs can do the same as a commando and ravager but its a lot less potent they cant build a chain gauge alone but they can slower it a little bit  a lot less than commandos but still a little bit and when you get the gauge filled the enemy becomes staggered when their staggered they can basically be destroyed their defenses are lowered and most of the time they become susceptible most status ailmentsoverall it makes the battle much easier but this really makes for a fun challenging battle and always you never really get a feeling that youre overpowered against other monsters because really if given a chance they would scrape you  and hard but if you go about it right everything will be finechrystariuma chrystarium is the name of the thing where you develop skills some say its like a sphere grid i guess its like that but just a bit worse anyways you unlock the ability to actually change roles at chapter 3 of the story and it did make the game much more funeach character starts off with their main role and throughout the story they unlock about 2 more you can only choose from all the roles halfway throughout the game meaning that sazh only has 3 roles until the middle of the game in which all 6 roles are unlockedits ok i guess even though i kind of wanted them to follow different role paths but its fine what i really dislike is that not all characters can learn the same skills each character basically has a main role so if you max sazh as a ravager he has a few of all elemental skills but his main ones are like firaga and some other aga and if you maxed snow as a ravager hed have blizzaga and some other aga as his main ravager skills this is really annoying because you cant develop a super ownage character and it basically forces you to use certain characters in certain battles because they all have something the other one doesntespecially when you have your favorite character and you cant even use them that much because they really arent much of an asset to the team even though its ok for the most part i still would have liked to have that i am all powerful feelingthe chrystarium has 10 levels which are all unlocked throughout the story every time the chrystarium levels up you can learn more skills you unlock level 10 after you beat the game when you beat the game it asks you to save then when you reload that save youll be before the boss battle in terms of story but after the boss battle in terms of points gained and stuff then you just run and go through a portal to start the farming and sidequestsmiscellaneousthe game features eidolons aeonsgfs each character has 1 and they can only be used by the party leader so the ai wont use them only the person whos party leader is able to use it because its a technique and ai cant use techniquessadly even though their summons they arent strong at all youd be lucky if you can kill the easiest mobs with the eidolons limit break really very lucky really though they make a good asset to battle because when summoned your 2 ai partners disappear and its just you and the eidolon in battle the reason they make a good asset is because 1 they use curaga when your hp is low so the only times you can really die is when your taking major quick damage 2 when you die they use arise which makes the eidolon disappear but revives you 3 they have a mode called gestalt mode in which you basically cant get hurt because for some reason the enemies cant even target you but anyways your eidolon turns into whatever kind of vehicle you get on then you have a selection of different skills you can use for example if you hold the left analog down then press x youll do this move or if you hold the analog stick left or right then press x itll do a different skill and if you press triangle it does their ultimate move even though it is in no way an ultimate move  in terms of damage it still looks niceand most importantly of all when your summon is desummoned in any manner you and your party will be completely healedone bad thing about summoning them is that if the enemy is staggered or has a chain gauge near full using the eidolons ultimate attack will clear it and whats left of the stagger on enemies so youll have to restart filling that gauge which is bad if youre fighting a hard monster but its fine i guess  im just sure we all would have liked to see eidolons do 100x more damageyou can upgrade your weapons and thankfully all weapons can be upgraded to an ultimate weapon how it works is there are 3 tiers of weapons 1 2 and 3 the third is the ultimate weapon it doesnt matter what weapon you start with but each ultimate weapon is different depending on what weapon you start out with if you start out with a weapon that greatly reduces max hp but has stronger offensive power and upgrade it to an ultimate weapon then that weapon will do a lot of damage but in turn it will reduce your max hp by 70 if you start out with a weapon that allows for faster chain building then the ultimate weapon will come out with faster chain building even though youd probably only be able to afford 1 catalyst needed to transform a tier 2 weapon to a tier 3 there still are various types of ultimate weapons even though they retain the same look and name no matter what weapon you start with the effects all differgil gil is hard to come by unless you farm it if you beat the game without doing that many side quests then you could easily have about a total of 500000 gil left maybe less depending on whether or not you buy materials to upgrade weapons the only way to get gil on here is to farm certain enemies which you can easily do once you get to the portal section of the end game area you can farm one enemy which is tougher than a fat baby no offense or just go a simple route getting a nice amount of money each run about 80k and it doesnt last that long but anyways its no deal breaker it makes it worth farming though which is a nice difference in gamesyou dont actually gain the ability to switch your partyparty leader until like halfway through the game which is kind of annoying because you might want to play with sazh or snow at some points but they automatically force you to use so and soits ok i guess but even more so in the beginning of the game i wanted to play with certain peoplei easily spent 70 hours on this game and plan to spend quite a few more hours its actually fun trying to see how i should go about this next battle or what i should upgradeoverallin total i give this game a 4 because it just messed up on a few things like not being able for all characters to have at least most of the same skills etc even though it can easily be given a 5 i just cant as far as people saying youve brought disgrace to this familys name goes they can shut it all up never through the game did i say wow this game ruined final fantasy for mewhoever says that never was really connected to the series anyway just wants to say something of course we all have our personal opinions and you can hate the game deeply if you want but to say that im never playing final fantasy again just because one game out of the series is actually different then what does that say about you even if this game was bad and all the innovating stuff wasnt innovating to me i still wouldnt say disgrace id just say man they really messed up ill have to see whats nextwe all are different types of game players im the type that gives a game time to develop and appreciates it for what it is and not downing it because its different from its counterparts i actually like story lines i dont always like jumping in and slashing and shooting everything in site personally i play a final fantasy game for the story line i dont understand how anyone can expect this game to be something its not of course it doesnt have the same aspects as others but it still does a wonderful job at what it has and i had and am still having a lot of fun with it and am glad i spent money on itif you dont like boring story linear rawr111 which this is non of anyways but you just need something to blame your dislikes for the game on then you probably shouldnt get this gamebut if youre like me and dont play that many rpgs and was looking for something to slip on then get this its very fun interesting amusing and most of all its one of the few games that remains fun after beating it good luck hope this helped',\n",

       " 'i am a bit surprised by the negative reviews so i decided to leave my ownyes the game is linear i personally have no problem with that just about every game is linear in the sense that you progress a storyline that is sequential in time weather or not you have breaks in between where you can wander of  explore  do other quests unrelated to the main plot is not such an important feature in my eyes its nice to have of course and i enjoy it but its not all that important if the main plot is solidi loved the story however i did go trough the trouble of reading up the text entries on your journal that supplement what you see in the cutscenes nowadays people seem somewhat affronted by content that is not conveyed though videoaudio i have no problems reading up a few paragraphs every now and then and by doing that i got to enjoy the storyline quite a bitgraphics are phenomenal i guess we all agree to that so i wont waste much time discussing itbut the main selling point of the game for me is the battle system i found it an amazing leap on the right direction that i hope is picked up and refined for future games of the genrethe traditional rpg games are about resource management you enter a dungeon with a given amount of resources mana points and hit points for instance and your task is to manage those such that you get to the next rest area alive so the battles are really attrition events where your resources are slowly eroded away over time by damaging enemies and taking damage you can almost always supplement resources with items you spend which can turn currency as the final resource to manage the dungeons almost always culminate with a boss battle that will have you spend all your resources to defeatno games are more representative of this playstyle than the orininal ff games ff13 departs from that model very drastically and i guess its understandable why so many are puzled by itfor starters you only have one resource health and it is renewed automatically at the end of each battle as a consequence of that the fights even the mundane enemies are not meant to erode your resorces they are meant to chalenge you of course the earlier battles are easier but the game picks up in dificulty quite a bit and you get the distinct feeling for most of the game that if you dont play well even the random everyday monsters can kill you their attacks take off significant chunks of your life etcalso they have done an incredible job at the different roles available and the way they interact with the paradigm system you have two types of damage dealers commandos and ravagers that interact in bringing the enemy to a staggered stage that cause it to take substantially more damage most of the battles are really about managing the stagger bar because the regular attacks will deal insignificant damage and defeating the enemy is really about maxing out the stagger statethere are also more situational roles like the medic healer buffer debuffer and tank the game does a great job at making each of them relevant for several of the fights particularly boss battles but even some more mundane enemies can only be defeated by clever use of buffsdebuffsso the game has a lot of depth by having you design your combinations of role compositions paradigms for you to shift from one moment in the battle to the other most people complain about the autobattle system making the choices for you but that is because the real decision on the battles is the paradigmn shifts going all offensive with all 3 characters having one heal and the other two buffdebuff or having one tank and two others heal when in trouble etc i found that emphasis to be a lot more fun than deciding to use ability a versus ability b versus ability c for instancei hope they pick up the trend of this battle system in future games i find myself sorely missing it when i play other rpgs my favorite genre',\n",

       " 'i wanted to complete final fantasy xiii before i wrote an adequate review and im glad i did as we all know ffxiii has gotten a lot of bad publicity from everyone well i can honestly say that its not as bad as what everyone says nor is it as good as what big publications say either the game itself is just okay the end periodpoint 1linearity all the complaints about the game is actually justifiable its absolutely linear completely non interactive and just plain sterile the exaggerated notion that the game is basically a corridor game is in truth correct the layout of the each section in the game is just going from point a to point b nothing more nothing less there are branching parts that leads to either dead ends or treasure but even then its far and few from beginning to end the players will be following a set path that leads from start to finish this game is the absolute pinnacle of linearity not even the original final fantasy 1 was like thispoint 2townsnpc towns are completely devoid of interactivity i wouldnt say there are no towns because there are three actually but what you can do withing those towns are pretty much none existence you wont able to visit homes because there are none you wont be able to purchase items because items accessories and weapons are bought through save points and you wont be able to speak with npcs because they talk automatically once you move by them its more as if youre hearing them speak when you pass by than it is actually starting a conversation with them the towns are also like the rest of the maps its basically once again going from point a to point bpoint 3battle system the battle system is a mixed bag for me sometimes i enjoy it sometimes i dont and sometimes it feels very boring and like a chore if youre unaware of ffxiiis battle system its completely new to the series your party consists of three members and players only control the party leader the rest of the members are ai controlled battles occur in real time and are pretty fast i wouldnt say its lighting fast but its faster than the rest of the main series to help players easily navigate through the speed of the battle system there is an auto button that will smartly choose what actions to take during battles if you want to still manually input your commands you can also do so but you would have to have pretty fast reflexes and cognitive decisions to keep up with the pace actions are separated into sections bars and commands are inputted and queued awaiting the atb bar to fill up before proceeding for example when you have three action bar you could press attack attack attack during the time the atb is filling up and once it does the action is performed there are also different roles for each of the party members to change into which will change the abilities available these role are similar to tanks casters buffers healers etc its every similar to final fantasy x2 dress grid where youre able to change into a different dress to again different abilities expect in ffxiii you wont be changing dresses these role swaps are crucial to defeating enemies so dont think that you can tank your way through the entire game you have to strategically swap roles or enemies and especially bosses will decimate your party there are no magic points in the game so you can use as much magic as possible and items are distributed throughout your entire party at the end of the each battle your partys hp will replenish itself so theres no need to heal outside of battles whether all this is a deal breaker to players or not i can see why the developers decided on these choices you will be battling a lot of enemies throughout the game so its very counter intuitive if you have to heal yourself after every battle the game also doesnt provide you with a lot of items nor money and purchases are only available through save points so it doesnt make sense to have to heal outside of battles its basically all about stream lining the game and these choices help to really keep the pace smooth and consistingnow like i mentioned earlier the battle system is sometimes fun and sometimes a chore i saw a video review where the reviewer summed up the battle system as pressing x x l1 and x unfortunately thats pretty much what the battle system is you press x to select your option then l1 to change roles and followed by your last xs to finish the command every battle consists of this formula and as you play further in the game it becomes extremely boring theres also the complaint that once your party leader dies the game ends well i dont have a problem with that because you can always retry the battle if you die whats good about this is that when you retry you get the option to change your battle configuration and updates to your character before engaging the enemy again what i found extremely annoying withing the first 30 hrs are the sections where certain battles are meant for certain party members and when engage your configurations are reset i often died during these sections to have to retry and reset my party configurations it was a major annoyance to meokay for the good ffxiii has amazing graphics for this generations rpg its very sad that the graphics are restricted to the narrow environments but its beautiful graphics non the less the story is also pretty good in fact the story was actually the part of the game that kept me playingas far as how the game is i found it to be okay and only okay im not sold on the battle system it was fun at first until i realized the basic fundamentals and it became boring i absolutely did not enjoy the linearity of the game and its non interaction people like to compare ffxiii to ffx well in a sense they are similar but not exact ffx was linear but heres where the line is drawn you can interact with npc explore towns buy items from item shops backtrack to a previous area participate in mini games and side quests revisit towns and explore hidden areas when you have access to an air ship in ffx ffxiii has non of that you cant backtrack you cant interact with npcs there are no mini games and only one side quest no revisiting towns and no air ship what you can do is participate in a side quest that involves hunting down creatures similar to ffxii hunt marks side quests upgrade your weapon and accessories and collect trophies reviewers like to say that the linearity ends at a certain part within the game near the end well thats just not true what they are talking about is the option to reexplore a vast area that consists of a gorge and monsters exactly like ffxs calm land just larger this is also the area where you take part in the monster hunt side quest which in turns take you all over gran pulse again and again area to area point a to point bso should ffxiii be played or avoided all together well honestly it depends i did have fun during my time with the game it just wasnt as fun as the rest of the series i had a lot of moments of boredom and irritations and a few moments of awe and wows but honestly this game should at least be rented and tried out its not the most disgusting and worst ff series developed but its not the next generation ff we were all expecting after all besides the graphics theres nothing in ffxiii that couldnt have been done with the last generation consoles',\n",

       " 'no spoilersfirst things first before you play this game at all you have to do one thing go to settings and change the default from autobattle to abilities  this is really necessary if you want to feel like your playing the game not that the game is playing you  you still have the ability to choose autobattle which can be a decent option if you want to save yourself the annoyance of pushing x needlessly in easier battles and unfortunately your battle options are limited enough in the beginning when your learning the battle system that you will get bad habits and wont enjoy the game later on because when do right the battle system is immensely funsometimes autobattle and picking your actions will result in the same choices but the key to battles is timing and after some experience you will get a feel for the how quickly the action bar will refill and once you learn that you  can click through the selections of which action which target etc in a rhythmic pattern to get the exact right timing  the feeling of attacking your enemy exactly when hes about to strike and and interrupting him or using an area affect right when the enemy pulls back into the crowd never fails to satisfy  but if you just click though your options as quickly as possible you will miss of waste your attacks and take allot more damage  theres allot more going on in these battles then pretty animations though they are gorgeousnow i am no where near the end of this massive game but i waited until i was far enough into the game until i had decided weather i was sold on the games unique aspects or not  as it says in  the title of this review this is not your fathers or mothers lets be fair final fantasy  theres no towns though there is shopping this i didnt think would bother me because the part i always hate about jrpgs is wondering around aimlessly in town x and the game is linear especially in the beginning  ill be honest with you at first this feels weird and it certainly took me a while to get comfortable with it  but something happened around hour three for me i started to get immersed in the storythey did a great job not giving you any idea what the heck is going on which for me causes an insatiable desire to play further and then suddenly you completely engrossed in tis story youve nailed down the combat and suddenly you no longer even notice how different it is until you realize that actually the way in which they allowed the game to unfold was a perfect way to introduce the characters to you  this isnt the main character driven story of games like ff7 and as a result it would be hard to create a player attachment to this motley crew in any other way  im not saying that youll love this though if you want the main character focuses story and traditional gameplay with no exceptions dont bother but if your main draw to these games is story and really feeling like your guiding an epic tale towards its ending while mastering a new and unique battle system which has always been my thing then you will like this gamegreat story or not it can take it a little bit out of your hands with the cg and i wish i had a little bit more control over every character in my party so i give it a fun factor of 4 but it must be recognized that visually this game is ridiculous cg and in game will blow you away and the audio is absolutely top notch one of the best imo so i bumped it up to 5 however if you dont have a hd tv or surround sound this wont have mcuh effect on you will itso great game not traditional but i have been much more sold on this new approach then some others out there so if you anything like me i would definitely give it a try or youll be missing out on a great story one of the better ff stories imo much better than 10 and addictive gameeditmy score still stands but as i am close to 20 hours in to this game you get your moneys worth i want to note a couple of things i have noticed  first i have encountered one instance although only one where the linearity of the game felt broken  without giving away spoilers i will just say that one might get into trouble if they specialize their characters too much because the game insists on switching up you battlegroup and even changing its numbers and so one day you will need to use lightning as a medic  it doesnt seem logical when she can be such a better anything else basically since the game is linear it means there isnt the same opurtunity for grinding so if you get stuck what you have to do is go backwards and use old enemies instead but this gets highly repetitivehowever this incident made me realize two things that i felt people should know before getting or starting this game you will basically max out everything eventually there is not like the materia system in ff 7 where the player decides what to focus on on the plus side all the none combat moves of each class work all the time so 10 hp for medic and 10 to commando will work for that character no matter what class heshe is  this is a very positive thing which for some reason didnt occur to me right away i dont know whythe result is that you best advice and really only advice is to pursue everything in a fairly balanced manner with a little bit of room for personal choice about what you acquire first but at the end of the day it will be a wash you will get everything  on one hand this means you dont get to craft your characters to your will like in other ff games but it also allows for a lot of satisfaction for every single thing you unlock  also if you know this before hand unlike me it means that the player will always be ready for what comes nextat the end of the day this is all part of the more linear approach to the game that i mentioned before but didnt initially realize this aspect to it  the devs designed it so they could be relatively assured that they new your capabilities at every point in the game as design it accordingly  as i mentioned above this only broke once for me and it was slightly my own fault for trying to force specialization on a system which doesnt really allow for itthe conclusion is the same as before though this is part of makes the gmae hgighly addictive whcih isnt unusual for ff games but at the same time allows for the story which continues to impress to unfold rather quickly which is a bit unusual  the result is addictive and rewarding provided you accept that you arent in control of certain aspects of the game although i still insist that in the actual battles their is great room for skill and technique and the devs added a score system to rate you each time which is a nice little recognition of your continued efforts to master the gamehowever as a contrast to the more restrictive aspects mentioned above the ability to actually level up your equipment and weapons is a very nice and player centered aspect of this game which i am quite happy they added  it really adds something to the whole levelingup aspect of the game and provides a further reward to each battle  btw cedit chips are not for upgrades they are for selling be careful of that  sometimes the yforget to explain certain things but its much preferred to the mountains of text regarding everything that one had to read in previous iterations of final fantasy cough 10 coughwell not much else to say than i am about to play some more  which really says more about the game then any review',\n",

       " 'i play a lot of rpgs this is in general jrpg wrpg all types all walks have for about 20 yearsi have to say that this one may border on one of the worst ive ever played now i have to commend the presentation the aesthetics the art the music the visuals on the whole its also a very smooth kinetic title its pretty spiffy to play throughthe problem is just how vapid it is were talking just ridiculous levels of nongame this is from the team that put out ffx2 while outside of being very goofy and girlpower happy had some fantastic gameplay systems associated with it ffxiii does not the entire progression for all of the title sans chapter 11 is walking down a hallway from a to b this may not sound like the pits but once you tie that in with no deviations it really gratesthere are no towns no real subquests or elements several key character points are actually abandoned because there is no way to present or address them due to the limitations of the design now thats bad but you can still make up for that as an onrails experience well it doesnt the combat engine can from start to finish barring the last couple dozen hunts be breezed through by mashing x and rarely doing a class swap in order to defend or heal upeverything is automated all ability selection bad ai  team mates if they took away that random class juggle the game wouldnt be a gameusually rpgs make up for lack of action or input with micromanagement or planning or strategy there is none of that the character development here is done through a crystalarium sp board which is completely linear and weapon upgrading which is also completely linear there is no thought no deviation you grind and you grind more and you mash xbad enough yet well you get no choice over your party character classes or anything else for the first 25 hours of the gamejust unrealthats the gameplay now the story is a whole nother trainwreck basically just prepare to hear1 falcie2 lcie3 focusrepeated ad nauseum for the 3540 hours the main quest takes because between hours 2 and 39 there is no narrative progression its a lot of jargon a lot of dwelling on the same points a lot of awkward grunts and sighs and a dash of dtier anime charmone single character has dialogue that isnt so completely banal that itd make a high school av club moan and thats sazh sazh is a character still rooted in the 50s as far as black characters go but he is still a big improvement on say the likes of barret from final fantasy vii kudos japanthe game actually tries to present itself like a big character drama and also a big story sweeping two vast worlds but fails rather spectacularly in both with a vastly underdeveloped cast and world designs that have no lore history or general consequence to them and act more as a general potluck of random themes and designs sort of akin to a themed mario worldthe worst part of all of this is that any little bit of story or context or sense you wish to gleen from the game has to be read through a haphazardly written datalog in the menus if you expect the game to actually tell its story through actual sequencing and design then guess againits not the worst game ever made its easy to cut through as it puts absolutely no strain or resistance on the player and it looks gorgeous while being cut through i can think of bigger crimes than merely being a design train wreck there are titles that are technical and design train wrecksstill worst in series avoid my suggestion would be to scope out resonance of fate which is a challenging mechanically innovative title with some good charm probably the best jrpg this generation after demons souls',\n",
       " 'warning  this review may contain spoilers depending on if i understood what the heck was actually supposed to have happenedwhen i am old and dying in my death bed i will surely think back to this game  in playing time i dedicated somewhere between two and three days of my life around 60 hours and i am fighting the gnawing realization that that is time that i am simply not getting back  at that point i will understand with each sorrowful declining breath that i could have used that time to frolic in an open field write a sonnet create something beautiful fall in love  but no i spent it on a grinding nonsensical jrpgi grindingif you have any consciousness of this game at all you probably have heard from any number of sources that it is linear beyond belief  i really cant provide further insights into this other than to confirm it  not only is it a go from one point to another through a metaphorical though often literal tunnel it is constrained even under that paradigm  no branches or places to explore  no secret passages or easter eggs at least none that i found  no side quests until about 85 through the game just go from a to b to c to d  not only that but there is no randomness in the number or character of encounters for level 1 you will face 12 fights no more no less 12 pick up 6 items and view 11 cutscenes and gain a little over 1000 exp  everyone who plays level 1 will face 12 fights pick up 6 items view 11 cutscenes and gain a little over 1000 exp  as such everyone who plays this game will be at exactly the same level at the end of level 1  no variation period  full stopok youre saying  intro level  showing how to play the game  standard experience for everyone  no big deal  right  wrong  level 2 is just as bad 14 fights 8 items 15 cutscenes about 1000 exp so are level 3 level 4 level 5 level 6 level 7 level 8 level 9 level 10 level 12 and level 13  as a result there are just no real decision points at all you just progress down the road dictated by the rigid structure of the game  once you get to level 11 as highly flaunted throughout these reviews the world opens up and you can do some side quest but not really  you still have a small set of prescribed side quests abc which you must complete before you can get to a few more quests def which you must complete to get to a few more quests ghi etc  the result is that though the world is a little more open really it is kind of a big open field with a couple of side routes you still have pretty strict linearity imposed on youon last note on linearity which i think is a key point is that the game is easy in the extreme  if the game was any harder i guess you could kind of justify the linearity  that way you could at least use some strategy to get you through it all  however most of the game with a few notable exceptions is no harder than getting through a dvd menu  there is really no particular strategy for the first 75 of the game  you just keep pushing the x button to attack and change to healer if you really need to  as you have probably heard you only control one character at a time which really exacerbates the simplicity problemthe sum of these factors make the game really more like a long drawn out movie than a game  everyone is going to see the same thing as everyone else meet it with the same strategy as everyone else and end at close to if not exactly the same condition as anyone else  like stated above i would equate it kind of like navigating a dvd menu where you have to select each scene from the menu individually  i should add that thanks to the good people on the amazon review boards i did know that this was going to be linear going in but goodnessi should note that this would not be catastrophic if the story that you were grinding through was compelling and interesting which brings me toii storydid anyone see the movie hancock will smith as a misanthropic superhero anyone  well final fantasy xiii is hancock in video game form  but you say hancock was about yes yes stay with me here  hancock started out as a really interesting idea which disintegrated about half way through into some kind of nonsensical scifi voodoo which doesnt fit in the tone or narrative of the setup  they couple together and die off what  same deal with final fantasy xiii the premise starts off interesting though pretty convoluted  you live in a world called cocoon which at some time in the past was at war with another world called pulse  something bad has happened causing a forced removal of the population  ok  im with you  there are godlike creatures called im not making this up falcie which control and provide for the world of cocoon  ok got it  i can see where this is going  you become kind of superhuman helper called lcie not a typo which have a choice of either completing your mission for the falcie or getting turned into crystal getting a little into the jrpg weeds here but i can deal  as the story progresses you find out there are malevolent falcie which are trying to destroy the world to bring back their goddess which will destroy the falcie  they need to get humans to do it because of something about how humans can make their dreams come true  turns out that one or two of your party destroyed the world at some point in the past and have been in deep sleep crystal stasis actually for eons prior to the week earlier  really i mean reallynear the end something or other happens and im not being a wise guy here i truly have no idea what drove this you decide that you have to destroy the god that maintains the world  why is that a good thing  no idea seems like a rotten idea to me kind of an endoftheworld kind of bad idea  but i guess it made sense to someone writing storyboards outside of tokyo  the end of the game made absolutely no sense to me whatsoever  had i been a twelveyear old stargate enthusiast maybe i could have worked my way through it but alas my dual graduate degree proved inadequate to decipher this one  i should add that this was the big payoff after 60 hours of playadded on top of this everything is told in nonlinear flashbacks  this might have been a sensible narrative structure had there been some kind of logic to the order that the story progressed  instead you start on day 7 go to day 8 day 9 day 1 day 14 etc  the result is like watching memento on a busted dvd skipping from scene to scene with no context of why things are happening or whos motivated by what  remember also that as this is a 60 hour game the chance that someone is going to play it in one sitting is pretty low  if you play it over a number of days or weeks you have to mentally connect cutscenes from any number of days or weeks ago to current motivations to make any sense not of what characters are doing now but what drove them back in the previous cutscenes that you saw two weeks ago  by a couple of days in i just stopped caring and just took it as it came ok i guess we have to save the world now no i mean destroy the world no wait we are going to save it  ah ill just go down whatever tunnel comes next  in a way it is good that the game was linear because if i had to make decisions to advance the plot i would have zero basis whatsoever for taking one path over anotheroh and there is a character named vanielle and one named hope whose heads you will want to clonk together a la curly and moe  their character progression is like watching reruns of full house  its not funny its not cute its not original and it makes you want to stick an icepick in one ear and out the otherok last pointiii presentationas you have probably heard the graphics on the game are secondtonone  ill admit it  a lot of it is pretty neat  the only problem i really have is that the art direction seemed a little overwrought and overdone  kind of like if you gave advanced rendering tools to high school freshmen to see what they come up with  the result was that there was interesting stuff to look at but it didnt really provide much narrative support  as an example there is a savage jungle which you have to go through with all kinds of crazed maneaters  ok thats fine but why are all of the trees made out of computers  wouldnt that kind of imply that nature had somewhat been conquered at least in the area where huge leafy computers have been installed where the trees used to be  i dont get it  of course it wasnt just this one stage that seemed out of place  everything in this game was huge in scale and of mindboggling complexity  every wall was a swirling mainframe every corridor was a sculpted masterpiece  what it kind of reminded me of was avatar where everything was just a little too faaaabulous to be engaging to the audiencewhat i really wanted to discuss though is the huge contrast between aspects of presentation that were done well and those that just seemed phoned in at the last minute  you may have heard of the weapon and item system which was really just a last minute slap it together job  the only things you collect in the game are materials which beyond their name and amount of experience they give you your items have no differentiating qualities  the result is that your inventory is chalk full of 20 different items which really could be represented by a number  similarly side quests are strictly beast hunts with no real story development or reason behind it  now why is it that i want to kill the 200 foot turtle  cause i told you to thats why  considering the linearity of the whole quest structure they could have easily thought up some kind of narrative to drive this part of the gameconclusionso as i lay dying years from now i will think back to final fantasy xiii  i will think of the hours lost but more than that i will lament the potential that this game had  i have been a fan of the series since vii  that game was literally years behind this xiii but even with the simplistic graphics and relatively short main story it was leagues more compelling and engaging  i get the sense that with each iteration of final fantasy the creators are getting further and further away from basic storytelling and fun relying on technical advancements to fill widening gaps in imagination and playability',\n",

what it is this is definitely my favorite in the series despite not reminding me of the series at allstorythe story aspect of a game can be sort of an amalgamation of a few key points so i shall review each piece independentlyplot the plot is shown through cinematics so instead of long speeches that may leave you wanting to mash x until the dialogue goes away you can enjoy watching a guy give a speech that may leave you wanting to hit a few buttons to skip it there are a ton of cinematics in this game and the game told me most can be skipped but i havent actually tried this out yet as theyre just too amazingthe plot itself definitely isnt the best story ever told it starts off as a group of random strangers who must flee an enemy to being a group of random strangers who must do something without knowing exactly what it is they need to do while being branded as dangerous outcasts theres obviously more elements in there but the interesting parts would be spoilers and the uninteresting arent explored enough to be worth mentioningsetting the world is mostly futuristic with a bit of magic things such as robots and hovercraft are common magic is present but rare though all your characters have access to it and the weaponry includes a bit of everything including modern style pistols and folding swordscharacters the main characters are featured in amazons description and most npcs arent around long enough to stand out if youve played any jrpg you can have a pretty good idea of what to expectgraphicsfor those who care the game does look goodgameplaythe most important part of any game i shall break this down into key factorstravel one of the complaints i have with any game in which it is present is backtracking sometimes i enjoy having a chance to go back to an area and enjoy it some more i never enjoy having to spend hours traversing the same 10 square feet over and over again thankfully this game has eliminated any incentive to backtrack unfortunately you dont have much of an opportunity to go back to old areas to enjoy them again without starting a new game and working your way back there furthermore you are fully healed after every enemy encounter so that allows you to spend more time exploring and less time rushing back to the last save point or other healing devicethe minimap displays where you can go so there isnt any searching off the map to find hidden treasure there are invisible walls wherever the land in the minimap ends so theres also no walking to where you may logically be able to go if the game doesnt want you to as a person who likes collecting everything in a game but dislikes having to search unmarked walls and scenery to obtain stuff i liked this aspectthe game really isnt too linear its definitely more linear than an open world but less linear than games like sonic and most srpg and fps games i still managed to get lost but thats entirely due to my poor sense of directioncombat every final fantasy game ive played has had a different combat system so i went into this knowing that i couldnt know what to expect there is an active time battle aspect to it there is a gauge that is constantly filling until full of course that allows you to perform actions when segments are filled different attacks use up different amounts of the gauge and you can execute enough actions at once to use the entirety of how much gauge has filled going into the menus to select skills wont stop the gauge so you must know exactly what you want to do at all times if you wish to choose what skills to use however this game has a command known as autobattle that selects what the game considers the best set of actions to take at that moment and all characters other than your current commander are cpu controlledso you can just spam x like in every other final fantasy game and let the auto battle pick your attacks every time you want to attack so whats the point well by hitting l1 you can change the classes of all your characters though this does take time allowing friendly and hostile atb gauges to fill and therefore change your skill sets and thereby have some say in what course of action your characters will automatically take this still doesnt make the combat all that great as it basically plays itself but requires input so as to not be a cool movie then theres the chain gauge enemies have a gauge that when filled up causes them to take more damage the chain drops continuously so you have to pick the right time to switch classes and its so essential and has such an impact on the gameplay that it actually makes it something worthy of being called a combat systemthe combat is more strategic than anything else but no one buys final fantasy titles for strategy based gameplay still i enjoyed the system furthermore there is no point in level grinding i have spent more hours level grinding in previous final fantasy games than i have spent actually enjoying them other than xii in which a simple tactic makes you able to kill nearly anything regardless how many levels over you it is you do increase characters stats but you can do so whenever you feel like it and have the points for it in combat you earn points based on how fast you killed the enemy party you need a certain amount of these points to increase a characters stats or gain new skills however without having a set character level it just feels pointless with the ease of healing you do not need incredibly high stats to take anything down but you do need good stats to take them down quickly enough to earn bonus stuff',\n",

       " 'as many have said this game is not an rpg its not even an eastern rpg the director pretty much admitted it isnt and they are doing damage control people need to accept that but my review is not based on thatgraphics 1010battle system 310character development and design 710replayability 110i will review this further in two ways 1 as an ff game and 2 as a game in generalas an addition to the seriesthe replayability of every ff game since 7 has been immense in this game it is almost nonexistent towns have always been a staple even on the very linear games like 710 and that have been removed for 13 characters with the exception of sazh are all just rehashes of popular japanese stereotypical anime characters and i swear they just took the design of vaan and turned him into hope only whinierthe cyrstarium system loses replayability because each character only can go down their set paradigm group whereas 10 and 12 you made the choice which path or license to open why play the game again if you literally will be doing the same thing twice for the long interesting gameplay you say read onff games have typically gotten progressively longer as the technology allows ff12 took me over 60 hours just to play the base and over 120 hours to do everything but yiazmat this game weighs in at a measly 6080 hours including side quests and as one professinal reviewer said if youve got the endurance there are 30 hours of good gameplay 30 hours only why when the ps3 has so much room would the developers choose to cut down the length methinks because the casual fps gamer on xbox wouldnt be able to finish the gameff games have always been about allowing you to develop all your characters abilities whether those abilities were available as a set class like eastern rpg or open like western rpg this game gives you no option to choose the lead member until nearly halfway through the game you cannot control other party members they are control by the paradigm system which control has been in every ff gamethe save function is basically superflous when the main character dies instead of being transported back to a point 20 minutes ago you are put right back where you died remind you of an fps yes it was annoying to die in battle and go back in time but this game could have done this better and removed the save points with auto hdd savesthere are no shops towns or anything that is a classic ff high point instead you get a save menu shop that is bland and reminds me of the dead space holoscreens if you arent going to add towns why not at least add real shops like borderlands would that have been such a crimeand what the heck is the rating system experience and skill points in this game they are crystarium points have always been based on a set system that the number of enemiesdifficulty determines your points i am not sure but it seems like the cps are based on your rating fighting a boss as well the obvious levelup system of other ff games is gone and it merely fades into the background like levelling up in your typical fps or like devil may crygod of war etcas a game on its ownthis game is like a big step back in every element except graphics and voice acting the graphics well they are just stunning and as another reviewer said i was so happy when i started the game to see something finally using the ps3 capabilities the voices turn a mostly bland storyline devoid of any real substance and with a nebulous antagonist into something at least watchable but thats where the praise stopscharacters are boring sazh is the one exception because he is not the stereotypical brotha with an attitude that barrett was hes the only character i can even understand his motivations the other characters are not developed well although they do give significant backstory in the form of repetitive and boring flashbacks its like watching a series of events with no form function or eventual purposethe battle system while innovative is nothing but a button mashing fest for the first half of the game the director argues that this was intented to help the player learn the intensely tactical nature but i dont need 30 hours to do it you are constantly shifting paradigms to be able to heal or attack and your supporting characters do everything based on that limited control the control you do have is limited to inputting a series of commands but you cannot switch paradigms in the middle of a series so you are stuck only attack or only healing until you can hit l1 when the lead dies you all die my first reaction was what the heck is that overall its being heavily praised but its immensely uncomplicated and boring the game at the middle chapter even warns you when a creature is going to be tough it turns out it wasnt what kind of a game warns you with a text screen about an upcoming creature 15 hours into the gamea summary of the gameplay would be walk fight walk cutscene fight walk save rinse and repeat as others have said its a monster hunting festwhile i understand the developers desire to make a fresh fun game that is accessible to more people dont alienate your hardcore fanbase to do so keep staple elements if you are going to completely disrupt the battle system i like fpss and rpgs but most fps are a lot more interesting than just walk fight walk scene metal gear solid series is a great example of how to change the boring fps into a tactical and deliberate process not just mass killing of enemies',\n",

       " 'graphics  5 of 5sound  5 of 5combat  2 of 5enjoyment  2 of 5having played around sixteen hours of this game so far im honestly debating on if i want to continue the visuals are absolutely amazing however the linear nature of the game is really painful most earlier final fantasy games start out somewhat linear but break out into free roaming this game takes linear to a painful level there is more exploration in super mario 3 back on nesthere are many times where you will watch a cut scene get back to the game in order to walk twenty feet further down the path with no encounters in the path so you can reach the next cut scene for me these cut scenes get in the way of any kind of enjoyment of the game there are cut scenes approximately every ten minutesthe combat system also leaves a lot to be desired the autobattle system removes any point to combat as long as you have used libra on the creature once before you and all characters will automatically pick the best possible attacks to use also there are no levels in this game instead winning cp which is used for a system similar to the sphere grid in ffx with a slight side of ffx2 outfits this system essentially allows you to max out the section that they give you of the job role almost immediately and you will see no advancement until reaching a certain point in the story line when they will expand the path by which time youve collected enough cp to max that out again this level of cp is available by walking straight through fighting each battle no need to backtrack to grind as old as the grinding for levels became tedious in previous games this one leaves you missing that ability to grind a bit and get ahead of the level curveso im having to go with beautiful graphics and great sound but the game play seems more just an after thought interrupting the pretty cut scenes',\n",
       " 'ever since the release of final fantasy x each game in the series has been fairly controversial among the community from the online mmo of 11 to the final fantasy by way of charlies angels sequel to final fantasy x and the complete gameplay overhaul that 12 brought i havent played a completely awful final fantasy in years yet the general opinion of each tends to be very divisive what once was disappointing turns out to be the most underrated 8 and 9 yet what was the most influential turns out to be the worst 7 though i personally dont think so so now we come down to 13 a game long gestating in development first on a nextgen hardware and one that had an oddly controversial multiplatform announcement instead of a ps3 exclusive final fantasy xiii is finally released has the wait been worth it again like prior entries that depends on your tastes since this isnt one of those unbridled masterpieces that everyones going to love and only select few will be against as evidenced by the reviews on the site but personally im having a great time playing flaws and allstory in the city of cocoon the citizens live in fear of the lcie people that have have been touched by powerful beings known as falcie ones that have a task or focus to accomplish with certain rules in place for how to accomplish it but these people are usually seen as enemies and are hunted down and exterminated so when a group of people become branded by the falcie it becomes a race to outrun the forces that are after them as well as figure out what exactly their task is one of the best things about 13s story is that unlike 7 and 8 where the main character felt like it was their story this feels more like an ensemble where everyone pulls their own weight in the story and develop and in fact even some characters outright hate each other at first the bone of contention online it seems is the linearity as if these games werent linear before but here it feels more pronounced but the upside is that every time you pick up the controller you make progress in the story constantly moving and not spending 3 hours just to make sure youre not steamrolled when a new area comes alonggraphics ill say that uncharted 2s graphics definately impress but they never consistently stunned me sure it was all animated well but id see the jungle stage or the last level and id be floored but then other times id feel like eh looks good enough before it floored me again same thing with god of war 3 recently final fantasy xiii especially on a ps3 is a powerhouse from vistas and landscapes to character modelling and detail to just the overall crispness of it all this is one smooth and vibrant looking game especially considering the small load times and lack of game data on your hard drive and the fact that all this streams off the disc without barely a hitch is mighty impressive on an xbox 360 things look well enough but the smaller resolution aliasing issues and lack of texture detail tends to pop up but usually youd have to see both running side by side otherwise you wouldnt noticesoundmusic like 12 before it this soundtrack was not done by nobuo uematsu but a new composer in this case its masasha hamauzu known for his dual work on final fantasy x unlimited saga dirge of cerberus and saga frontier 2 the soundtrack here is definately way different than before with a slight electronicatrance vibe at times to the music the epic orchestral themes and even occasionally a vocal theme missing in action is the classic prelude crystal theme in place is a nice crescendo that builds in volume to the catchy battle theme and a chocobo theme with lyrics yep though nothing replaces odeka or ukele de chocobo the voice acting has also improved and theres not a lot of characters thatll make you cringe though it was strange theres no dual language option considering square actually hearing about the love people have for subtitlesjapanese audio but oh wellgameplay oh boy this is going to be hard trying to explain half of what 13 does different will be tricky but here goes you control one character at a time with the other 2 being ai and replacing mp are atb bars bars that actions will use up so the more powerful the attack the more bars it needs to use attack might be 1 bar whereas blitz an area of attack ability requires 2 so as long as you have the bars filled up you can use what you want which makes battles very straightforward and you no longer have to spend so much time using ethers and elixirs just to cure again another big chance is the paradigms essentially these function similar to jobs from the previous game though certain characters will have a better affinity for one job over another for instance lightning makes a really good commando and medic though she might be terrible at synergist oh yeah guess i got to explain those ones heres how it breaks down commando  melee medic  white magepriesthealer ravager  black mage saboteur  enemy debuffer deshell deprotect etc synergist  party buffer such as protect and shell whereas sentinels are basically the guards of the group taking damage in place of another team or to provoke an enemy to attack them exclusively a paradigm shift occurs when you switch roles for the members so you can have an allout team of melee users to dish damage but since theres no healer it prompts a shift to a group with one or two or all even medics to get your team back on your feet and back again its remarkably intuitive and pretty soon youll be switching paradigms on the fly because you know what to do and not just do whatever and hope it worksanother changesort of is how your summons worked named eidolons a la final fantasy ix by the way if you think its pronounced eyedohlawn be prepared for a rude awakening like i was they can be summoned into battle if your tp is at max and attacks alongside you but they can also go into gestalt mode where they for lack of a better term go into transformers mode and you control what attacks they use akin to 10 but the tricky part is your tp doesnt refill every battle like your hp does so you have to save your summons for when you absolutely must need them tp or technique points is how you do specific abilities that are independent of a class ability so for example a ravager might be able to have fire and water as abilities but the libra technique scan in other words is a technique by the way libra everything you see since the ai adopts that information into its programming so to speak so whereas before they used whatever attack they felt like if the ai knows that an enemy is weak against fire theyre more often than not to always use fire another awesome change is the retry picture this you need to level up to take down a boss but while in grinding mode you die by a generic enemy encounter and a good hour has been wasted prompting a far restart not so here here you can taken back to just before the encounter so if you got demolished just hit retry spawn outside that enemy go into your menu and reconfigure your party to what you feel is a better course of action which ties into the storylines progress as well theres not as much brick walls where you feel like screw it ill beat him tomorrownow as far as negatives out of the way well there is the fact that the game is noticeably linear in prior entries generally you moved to a specific area but the illusion of freedom was always present meaning you couldnt actually go that way because of the story world layout or simply because the enemies got too powerful but here you will notice how restricted your movements are and its not until a good 20 hours into it that it opens up and the game says okay run free little birdy also though this is just personal preference but the game reintroduces the sphere grid by way of the crystarium a more spiffier looking version of the grid doing battles nets you cp or crystal points which you spend on the grid to advance a specific stat such as strength 3 or hp20 and while its cool they did away with requiring a specific sphere to activate a node this time ever run out of ability spheres in 10 and werent going to level up until you found one none of that here but i kind of like the old level 23 type setup where if an enemy got too hard i got a good idea on how much levelling is required and though there isnt much need for grinding it does suck that i cant level up a specific skill when i do need to upgrade it but thats mephew thats a lot of talk but really this game has been in long development cycles massive amounts of hype fair bit of controversy concerning the linearity the weird disdain for it being on xbox 360 or the inclusion of leona lewis but honestly as a game this one is extremely fun unlike 12 which was a fun game though not a terrific story 13 tells a great tale while being insanely fun to play and thats kind of rare for the series doesnt matter what system youve got to give final fantasy xiii a try

       " 'note this review is very detailed but offers no significant story spoilerslet me preface this review by providing some context in the form of my experience with and thoughts concerning the final fantasy ff series at largeas most of readers are probably aware the ff games are a series of japanesestyle roleplaying games released over a period spanning two decades they have been highly acclaimed and unlike many video game franchises each one is usually remarkably different from its predecessor both in gameplay features as well as story elements while some core improvements are usually retained and they all share a similar flavor by and large each new entry in the series feels like a completely new game though it is true that some of the ff games have been stronger or weaker than others and diehard ff fans love to argue over which entries have been the bestmost people who have played even a few of these games would agree that all ff games have extremely high production values and even the worst ff is probably fairly described as better than the average video game experiencenow my pedigree i own every ff game that has been made with the exception of ff3 never released in the us except on the ds and the online versions ff11 and 14 up until recently i still was in possession of an original ff1 nintendo cartridge even though my nintendo has been long gone  something which should be taken as evidence of how much i love the series of these i have played and beaten every ff game except for two ff2 i just could never get into and quit very early on and ff8 i never finished i abandoned about at about 75 completion because the story just didnt hold my interest note that my completion record also includes the ff legend and adventure games on the original gameboyfrom my perspective the ff games generally have very creative settings but i find their execution to tend toward the flat or  unfortunately  downright confusing this has particularly been a problem with later entries in the series as technological developments have facilitated bigger cut scenes more dynamic visuals and extremely detailed story events which would have been completely impossible with older technology while the cut scenes and 3d environments certainly look great the actual storytelling hasnt kept pace this has led me to question whether there is a maximum level of story complexity that can feasibly be supported by the video game format if there is a few of the ff games have pushed too hard against this ceiling and suffered for itin addition to story issues there have been some gameplay features that havent worked or failed for one reason or another this is really just a ramification of the constant experimentation that ff developers do with the basic ff formula to squares credit this experimentation usually succeeds in making each new game feel fresh and innovative and so i can live with the occasional poor idea that creeps into a new ff game i do think that sometimes squareenix falls into the trap of including gameplay elements for the simple reason that such elements have always been there even if they dont mesh well with the architecture of the newly developed game a good example of this is the eidolons summons which have become increasingly irrelevant in later installments and especially so in the game under question and yet they continue to be included because well why thus in some ways the design of ff games is a contradiction striving to go in new directions yet stubbornly retaining a few random features for the mere sake of continuity i cant quite figure that outin any case when i bought my ps3 one of the first games i knew i had to have was ff13 so lets get to it shall wegraphics and soundthe production values of ff13 are staggeringly high the visuals are simply beautiful especially when you arrive on gran pulse later in the game drawing distances are incredibly long in environments where they are taken advantage of and the game keeps you interested if only because you want to see whats coming along around the corner settings are very detailed and bright although i will say that i was disappointed that the game doesnt feature any creepy environments ie crypts or dungeons of the classical sort its worth mentioning that the game runs very smoothly with nary a hiccup or framerate drop throughout in addition to the technical aspect the actual artistic design is very inspired and interesting i love most of the creature designs and costumes the sole exception being the foot soldiers  who look a little too much like cheeseridden star wars storm troopers  and the main antagonist and final boss who look  well  very bizarre character models are also very well done although fangs hair looks like something youd find on someone living in a trailer parkas far as music goes its fine i guess but i missed some of the nostalgic tunes  including the classic titlescreen music the battle theme was very underwhelming as was the victory theme that said some of the location music was interesting  there were a few nice jazzy melodies a new for the series i believe given the mechanical aspect of the games themes i think some more techno synthetic or industrial pieces would have been more fitting but thats just a quibble overall other ff games have offered better music but its not terrible or anythingsounds sound effects are pretty standard fare and the voice work is strong throughout a lot has been made of vanilles voice but to be honest it didnt bother me as it apparently did a lot of people i mean i wouldnt want to listen to her sing an aria or anything but prior reviews had me ready to listen to fingernails across a chalkboard her accent is admittedly a little strange at times but given her backstory this is defendablestorywith the exception of ff9 every ff game from 7 onwards i guess 6 also could fit here has taken place in a modern or futuristic setting where our heroes still  for some reason  fight with swords and spears even though they are fighting mechanical beasts tanks and spaceships wielding plasma or energybased weaponry ff13 continues this trendff13 takes place in the world of gran pulse and more specifically the artificial moonlike body called cacoon that floats above it the world of pulsecacoon is ruled by creatures called falcie however human interaction with falcie is minimal and for the most part these falcie see to the needs of human beings for instance on cacoon they provide light food energy etc and on pulse they do things like aerate the soil create new lifeforms etc some time ago the civilization on pulse at the behest of the pulse falcie attacked cacoon and tried to destroy it they were unsuccessful but the population of cacoon has feared a new invasion ever since occasionally the falcie can coerce individual humans into becoming unwilling servants to accomplish some task for the falcie  called a focus these servants called lcie gain magical powers but typically feared and ostracized by the rest of the population lcie generally dont know exactly what their foci are but if they dont accomplish their foci in time they turn into zombies of sorts called cieth and live forever that way the story involves a group of cacoonites who get transformed into lcie and have to figure out what their focus is which as you can imagine involves saving the world from one or more malevolent beingsok thats the story in a nutshell and i wont give more potential spoilers it touches on themes of fate and religion but its doesnt smack you in the face with them like ff10 didon balance i thought the setting was innovative and the cast of characters was interesting and likeable its nice that the lead is not an angstridden male adolescent rebelling against society as has been all too common in ff games there are initially some good sidestories involving the main characters the hopesnow interaction is particularly interesting early on though this is resolved before the halfway point these side stories peter out toward the end of the game however and i was left with the sense that the characters were a little underdevelopedfor the most part the story is much more accessible and engaging than that of ff12 which was  to my mind  a confused muddle because of the games structure more on that below the story also flows rather well proceeding from one event smoothly into the next there are no long lulls where nothing happens and this makes the story feel urgent and tense that said while the primary narrative is reasonably easy to follow it does  again in typical ff fashion  fall apart to some degree in the games concluding moments the main antagonists motivations are murky at best and the events in the final cutscenes are rather inscrutable for that matter the games story also doesnt start on a high note throwing the player into the action in medias res and clearing up a lot of details with flashbacks that arent always as informative as they should be the first few chapters are quite confusing particularly because they use lots of confusing terminology introduced all at once this might have been intended but the cut scenes and dialog do a poor job of describing what is happening and so for the first couple of chapters i found myself just playing without thinking too much about the story the game does try to help you out by giving you journal entries to read after major plot points but i found that these entries did not always coincide exactly with the cut scene i just watched  for example the journal entry might discuss cut scenes that happened in the past as if they were just revealed or talk about cut scenes i havent watched yet nevertheless reading these entries is  especially in the beginning  almost a necessity as i would have been completely lost without having them to fill in details and explain terminology that was just completely unclear from the live dialog this becomes less of a problem as the story unfolds and by the end i was not reading the entries at allwhile the quality of the narrative was generally very good compared to some of the other ff games one negative consequence of the games linearity and fastpaced story telling was the fact that the world itself does not come alive like it does in some other ff games because there is no overworld  the player doesnt get a sense of how one region fits both geographically and socially together with another indeed its not completely clear what exactly cacoon is moon planet dyson sphere there are no towns to explore except for one of the games chapter which plays out more like a dungeon than a classical rpg town and very few npcs to speak to and so the world ends up feeling hollow with few details being offered except those which can be gleaned directly through the main story arc this is especially disappointing because the games unique setting had a lot of potential another thing which really hurts the game in this regard is the complete lack of back story about the worlds creatures ff12 featured bibliographic entries on each encountered creature offering an often witty explanation of the creatures personality history etc while ff13 does offer an index of creatures each entry only contains statistics about hps elemental weaknesses etc which for the most part are useless anyway because well well get to that this was a wasted opportunity not just to flesh out the ff13 world but also to make the monsters seem relevant why am i fighting a giant mechanical behemoth shrugsgameplayit is no secret that ff13 was designed with some of the criticisms against ff12 and earlier ff games in mind unfortunately i feel squareenix completely overcompensated for some slight problems with earlier games and ended up introducing much larger problems into the formulalevel designff12 was criticized for being too open too directionless and too slow thus the ff13 designers opted to ditch an overworld altogether indeed for the first 10 chapters of the game the player navigates levels that are little more than long hallways punctuated periodically by cut scenes or boss battles or both there is very little exploration and rarely is there even a fork in the path all shopping more on that later and business transactions take place at save stations which are spaced at surprisingly short intervals although this might make sense given the fugitive nature of the main characters this design decision further restricts the players exploration and interaction space the game does open up briefly in the 11th and not coincidentally most enjoyable chapter with a largish area to explore and a ff12inspired monsterhunt minigame to solve but then its back to the long linear slog through the 12 and 13th chaptersthe upside to this approach is that the story is much more tightly scripted compared to the ambling ff12 and flows at a very measured pace there are absolutely no pauses or breaks from the action and the player never wanders aimlessly wondering what to do in fact the developers have defended their design as necessary to tell a good story im not sure thats a defensible argument and in any case the downside to such a design is far heavier than the seamless storytelling that is the benefit the game almost feels claustrophobic and though the visuals are pretty the alltobrief opening of the game in chapter 11 feels almost more like a gasping breath of fresh air than it does an inspiring moment ive seen platformers with less restrictive level designadding to the linearity problem is that until chapter 9 you also have no choice over what your party makeup is while there are 6 playable characters in ff13 the game tells you exactly which ones you may use at any given time and which one is your teams leader thus even as a dungeon crawl the game fails because the one thing that should be enjoyable  experimenting with the battle system  is ultimately unsatisfying because you are forced to have your party composed the way the game want you to compose itbut the battle system is a whole separate can of wormsbattle systemwhile ff12s main story was one of the more disappointing in the series where it really shined was its battle system in fact id venture to say that of all the ff games ff12 had the best most enjoyable combat mechanics thus i was eager to see what ff13 would have to offersadly it is a mess and easily one of the worst in the seriesas in ff12 your party consists of only three characters at a time and like ff12 you only directly control one of these characters however here the similarity ends while ff12 battles take place live this is not the case in ff13 upon bumping into an enemy  usually impossible to avoid because of the confined level design  the player is whisked away to a special battle screen at this point you direct your controlled character to attackhealcast a spelldefenduse an itemetc and the aicontrolled characters do likewise but while in ff12 you had gambits whereby you could script the aicharacters to act pretty much in any way you wished them to you have no such refined controls in ff13 what you have are paradigmsthere are six job classes in ff13 which though having fancy sounding names boil down to a warrior magicuser defender buffer debuffer and healer each character specializes in three of these although toward the end of the game you can develop any character in anything if youre willing to level grindparadigms are combinations of these job classes an offensive paradigm may involve two of your characters as warriors commandos and one as a magic user ravager while a more defensive paradigm may involve two healers medics and on defender sentinel to control your party during battle you may switch between paradigms at any time so for instance you might start off in a paradigm that emphasizes buffing and debuffing then switch to one that maximizes offensive firepower and then when youve taken some abuse quickly change over to one where your support characters are medics or defenders before switching back to offensethis sounds good on paper and indeed it might work out really well but there are some serious problems with its implementation in ff13for one thing you have no control over how the ai characters prioritize what specific actions they take within the very broad boundaries of the job theyre currently assigned to so while you might have twenty status ailments that need removing your medic focuses on healing rather than esunaing nothing you can do unless of course youve assigned your main character is a medic but you can only perform an action on one target on a turn even if you have enough action points to cast the spell three times in a turn so youll have to do it all manually which is practically impossible in this battle system because things happen so fast this goes for debuffs as well  if you are fighting an enemy that is vulnerable to slow and deprotect and youd rather it be slowed the ai controlling your debuffer doesnt care it will cast whatever it wants to leaving you in the cold no gambits in ff13 equals no control although gambits certainly would have fit into the system nicely i cant really figure out why square made such a regressive design decisionin addition you can only preprogram 6 paradigms at any one time while all the 200 some combinations wouldnt necessarily be useful i found myself handicapped by not being able to switch to the combination i needed of course i could always replay the battle with reprogrammed paradigms but this is annoying because each paradigm has to be reprogrammed manually and in fact this has to be done often after scripted events which change your party makeup  something i found endlessly annoying i guess you could defend this by saying that prechoosing your paradigms adds a strategic element to the game but its an artificial restriction that doesnt make much sense and in any case theres no reason why square couldnt have at least allowed you to store more than six paradigms even if you could only take six with you into a battle at the very least this would save the player a lot of tedious programmingbattle in ff13 takes place in real time and its fast the first time you paradigm shift in each battle theres an extralong animation that you have to endure  and battle is so fast that you find yourself sometimes being pummeled during this animation you can in theory input your commands for a turn manually but there really isnt enough time to do this and still be efficient thankfully theres an autobattle command which analyzes what the enemy is weak to provided you have scanned it and sets your turn accordingly therefore 95 of the time battles amount to little more than repeatedly hitting the xbutton and switching paradigms when needed the only strategy that comes into play is in determining when to switch paradigms from offensive to defensive to buffdebuff  theres almost no micromanagement of actions at all which might appeal to some people but doesnt appeal to me this is all by the way exacerbated by the fact that you have no direct control over where your characters are standing during battle meaning your susceptibility to areaeffect spells and attacks is completely randomoverall the game is not very hard aside from some special enemies near the end which are optional i rarely felt challenged that doesnt mean i didnt die a lot because i did in ff13 its game over if your lead character dies which doesnt make much sense the same character can be raised if heshe is a support character and also leads to losses feeling cheap and unfair particularly at the end of a long battle i dont know why they didnt do the ff12 solution to this problem with control passing automatically to the next character in line this feature also renders some spells such as raise much less useful in the hands of support characters than they should be but dont worry if you die you can restart right before battle and save points are everywhere which limits the tension of the game its true i usually dont like games where dying means having to replay 30 minutes of a dungeon but ff13 is ridiculous to the opposite extreme there should be some feeling of gravity to your decisions and moveswell thats the battle system there are some more details but i think my impression is clear  its a weak design that offers neither strategic complexity nor the thrill of weighty combat decisionsmiscellaneouswhat else is there with gameplay just two things character development and weaponsitems management both are big steps backward from earlier games in the seriescharacter development there are no levels in ff13 characters gain experience points of sorts from each battle which they use to improve characters using a system similar to ff10s sphere grid however this system is more linear than ff10s with the exception of deciding which job to put points into and the 3d presentation makes it very difficult to see what abilities are ahead without a lot of effort by the way ff games abandoned the traditional rpg leveling system a long time ago and i wish theyd go back to it  theres something satisfying about the sudden growth in power that accompanies leveling up  the gradual and incremental growth enhancement of later ff incarnations is much less satisfying a final note about character development is that in ff13 most of the characters are redundant the games difficulty is low and you can achieve maximum potential in each job class using only three characters given the scarcity of money for weapons upgrades and the cryptic nature of upgrading to begin with youll probably find yourself using only three characters the entire game its true that there are slight differences in the order which different characters get skills eg one character might get haste a lot sooner than another but ultimately they all get pretty much the same skill set when maxed out so theres not much reason to play around with different character combinations unless you are trying to take down the games very few superbosses after youve defeated the big bad at the end of the main story arcweapons and items are an even bigger mess than the game system and character advancement weapons and equipment no armor in ff13 can be upgraded at save stations by putting various items dropped by monsters and found in chests into them for experience points of sorts earn enough experience and the weapon goes up a level youre given very little information about this system and are forced to experiment some items apparently increase the experience multiplier of the weaponequipment and other items offer big experience gains but while there are hundreds of possible items it seems they basically only boil down to these two categories  a sort of false complexity they might as well have just had creatures drop red and blue orbs and been done with it in any case eventually your weaponsitems will top out at a maximum level but they can then be transformed into new weaponsitems using certain rare ingredients there are three tiers for each weapon type but over a dozen or so weapons for each character in each tier lightning for instance wields gunswords and there are a certain number of introductory ones to choose from which you find in treasure boxes throughout the game any one of these can be used and upgraded to higher tiers while upgrading to the second tier is straightforward getting to the third tier requires monumental effort and probably a faqthere are many problems with this system first money is very scarce particularly in the first half of the game meaning that you wont have much chance to play around with upgrading  youre better off consulting a faq and seeing what works second once youve put considerable effort into upgrading one weapon theres little sense in starting over again with a far inferior weapon that you find 8 chapters later really this kind of game design is completely perplexing to me because one of the main draws of an rpg is getting better equipment its almost impossible to find better equipment than what you have already upgraded and the differences between weapons are very slight it seems so this aspect of rpgs is almost completely neglected in ff13 by the end of the game i had literally dozens of bracelets boots buckles bags bottlecaps and a bevy of other doodads that just sat in my inventory unused and i stuck with the upgraded first weapons i found in chapter 1 throughout the entire game from what i can tell getting the items required to reach the final level of weaponry would take hours of item farming meaning that for the entire game each of my characters had a total of two weapons seriously square what the heck were you thinkingimpressionsi realize that this review seems to have mostly been negative graphics aside ff13 gives a very bad first impression and many aspects of it are simply not very good part of the time i felt it was a little more than a tech demo for the ps3 with almost no thought going into the critical aspects of game designthat said for the most part i still enjoyed playing it seems strange to say given my complaints but the production values visuals and even the story were strong enough to make it enjoyable to experience furthermore when the game finally opens up in chapter 11  with exploration minigames and god the beautiful sights to see  you really see what a ps3 ff game could be if done right if they had cut out some of the first few chapters and greatly increased the size and scope of chapter 11 and stuck with a modified ff12 gameplay system this could have been a game for the agesunfortunately what we get is a very pretty but deeply flawed experience which offers some color characters and an interesting setting but a complete lack of strategic depth underwhelming gameplay and very uninspired character development and traditional rpg elements if youre looking for a difficult deep rpg with some tension and consequences to your choices you wont find it herewhat should i rate the game well rather than giving it a numerical rating i think id rather just put it up against other ff games clearly it is not the best while it might be hip to deride ff7 for me this is clearly the high point of the sonyera ff10 was also a strong entry ff8 and ff12 had some good gameplay but lackluster stories that i just couldnt get into  although the latter had the best extended minigame of the series ff9 was a bit of a mystery offering a great game but some of the worst rpg character models ever in video game history seriously zidaneits hard to compare ff13 to anything earlier than ff7 because its difficult to normalize for technology changes over such a wide range of years but im inclined to think ff13 doesnt hold a candle to ff4 or ff6for me ff13 is a slightlybelow average ff game its better than the worst but its gameplay system holds it back too much to make it a very engaging game it has very little replay value i certainly wont play it again but i dont regret playing it the first time its worthy of bearing the ff name but i was hoping for better the last two ffs that ive played ff12 being the other have been canvases painted in black and white  featuring some of the strongest features in the entire series but also some of the weakest maybe ff15 will get it rightscore ok i couldnt resist 6510 for reference id rate the other ffs as followsff1 810ff2  didnt finishff3  never playedff4

       " 'i shot through this game in 5 days not every sidequest but several three of these days were sick days heh im still finishing the more advanced side missionsthere are a hundred reviews so ill try to be brief im not looking to compare final fantasies because they are all individual games with separate mechanics and stories comparing them to each other is only a matter of personal taste because they are very different from one another in every way except for the extremely high level of quality in every productionthe graphics are incredible there were several times where i would just stop in the middle of what i was doing just to pan my camera around there is immense detail in every single piece of art in this game and it is aweinspiring at times im glad i bought the ps3 versionthe first 20 hours of the game were very frustrating for me i made no decisions and the game sort of played itself i am a huge fan of the less linear final fantasy games and this is not one of them this is a common gripe ive found but it doesnt make 13 a bad game it just makes it different final fantasy 10 was very linear but most people still liked itthen it started to build up and my options expanded once i was able to choose my party members myself and do side missions i was a happy camper the farther i got into the game from that point on the more i liked it the battles get very difficult and the challenge is very welcome in my eyes the limited control you have over your companion characters gets less annoying once they learn more of the abilities you want them to use the ai gets quite good later in the gamethe story is very difficult to grasp at times the bonds between the different characters are very interesting but some of them are very weak too im still not fully aware of why one or two of them are even sticking around with the rest at all its not very easy to care about some of the characters like vanille and fang  despite these flaws the story is still entertaining and satisfying by video game standards even if not by final fantasy standardsconclusion the game starts very slowly but your investment of time and patience is wellrewarded by a good story and lots of fun and challenging battles near the endfor rpg fans who didnt buy the game on its release dateyou are probably not a hardcore square enix fan like many of the reviewers here are i think that final fantasy xiii is an excellent game if you are looking to spend a nice big chunk of time 40 hours on it if you are looking for something more in the 2030 hour range i would instead suggest mass effect 2',\n",

       " 'the story is a pleasure the characters develop slowly and show you their true colors with time and the world is just visually stunning i really enjoyed it i buy final fantasy games because i want a good story and a cinematic experience so for me this game delivered on those two aspects but i miss the traversable world map i just love being able to walk around a sphere or globe discovering continents islands caves and everything else that can be explored in between you cant revisit places in final fantasy xiii you can only go forward i wasnt crazy about the battle system eitherive heard that they are producing this traversable world map for final fantasy xiii versus i really hope so so ill be looking forward to that and if its like kingdom hearts in terms of liveaction for the battle then yeymy favorite battle system so far has been the junction system of final fantasy viii which i hated at first and then realized how awesome it was and how i could literally modify each character to become practically immune to everything and deliver a hefty slice of 9999 damage in battle after that system i liked materia which you could develop and master in final fantasy vii and then thats it i didnt care for the ffx grid and i dont even remember the ffix system which goes to show how memorable it was to me  the battle system in final fantasy xiii i just didnt pay much attention to i was more concerned with the story and wanting to get the battle over with so i could jump into the next sceneas for fun i gave it a rating of 3 stars i wanted to know more and more and more and i would play hours on end my parents nearly kicking me out of the room so clearly its fun but i took one star down because having no way to revisit locations takes part of the fun out for me if i cant explore the world its just not as fun i took the second star down because ffxiii does something similar to ffxii that i didnt like missions basically you just have to eliminate targets to get items it tires me because every mission is exactly the same just get the target and go kill the monster and then get your reward in every other final fantasy you had to find items by either battling your way through hidden levels or figuring out puzzles there were also sidegames motorcycle races arcades dances multiplechoice dialogues not just sidequests which in ffxiii is basically the missions anyway and you could talk to people and get involved in their plight help them find some random object try and dig your way through the world and etc it was more about exploring less about being told what to doi didnt even buy the strategy guide because you dont need it buy it if you want an art book or if you collect final fantasy books the ending is done in a way that doesnt completely close the story either which means they can make a sequel to the game like ffx2 or ffxii revenant wings im not sure im liking this spinoff trend in final fantasy but ill wait and see i did still buy ffx2 after all and despite not taking it too seriously i really enjoyed it and found myself liking the lena storyline and nearly crying in the 1000 words scene actually ffx2 may not have been better than any other final fantasy game but it was definitely more fun than ffxiiithe story of ffxiii is good enough though that i can rate it three stars overall i was really curious about the lcie and the falcie and what this or that was and why or how it was related to the characters the background the history theres just so much its so richi also love riding wild chocobos and you can ride wild chocobos in ffxiii so points for thati would take off one more fun star because i miss the moogles but then again thats not reason enough to say its less fun i have to remember i still played so many hours that my family worried about my health so despite its shortcomings the game is in fact as addictive as youd expect from a final fantasy title and worth to buy',\n",
